    "title": "The Truth Becomes Clearer Through Debate! Multi-Agent Systems with Large\n  Language Models Unmask Fake News",
    "summary": "In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social\nnetworks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods\neither employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low\ninterpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific\nprompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results\ndirectly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the\nsaying that \"truth becomes clearer through debate,\" our study introduces a\nnovel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the\ninterpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a\nrigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our\napproach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the\nInsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where\none supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents\nengage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing\nstatements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse\nanalysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the\nInsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent\nand the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides\nan overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The\nAnalysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph,\nintegrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and\narguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.",
