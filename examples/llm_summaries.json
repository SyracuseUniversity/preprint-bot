We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from\nthree robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),\nacross different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments\n(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors\n(resolutions and event rates).

    "summary": "We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline\nthat synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel\ndata. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,\npractitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,\nor only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom\nboth. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely\non costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses\nthis by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise\nintermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs\nfrom IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,\nyielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five\nbenchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization\n(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired\nsetting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained\nonly on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora\nand other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated\npairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of\ndirect synthesis.

We\nmodel this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online\nLearning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis\n$\\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\\ast(x_t)$ or\na replayed label $\\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is\ncounted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the\nSOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.\n  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$,\nand prove matching upper and lower bounds that make\n$\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.\nA closure-based learner makes at most $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ mistakes\nagainst any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For\nstochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed\nclass. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound\nsetting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large\n$\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper\nseparation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is\n(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers\n$\\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the\n$\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ bound.

However,\nit suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.\nNaive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in\nthe traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of\nLRM.

    "summary": "The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex\nenvironments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement\nlearning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge\nopaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in\nwhich an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work\ndemonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only\nact effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world\nthrough explicit reasoning on raw experience.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the\nsame log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for\ndiffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),\noptimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow\nmatching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is\nan implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases\nvariance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce\n\\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for\ndiffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a\nlower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage.

This unifies\npretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with\npolicy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence.

    "title": "VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning",
    "summary": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few\nlabeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by\nincorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic\nfusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that\ncontradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual\ninstances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for\nFew-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts\nconditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly\nintegrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of\nCross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment\n(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support\nimages to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single\nstructured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of\nsemantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act\nrespectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level\nclass semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited\nsupport data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,\nand synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the\n3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear\nrelationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent\nmultimodal integration.

    "summary": "The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves\nmodels \"thinking out loud\" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought\n(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this\nlatent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we\nfurther propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous\nreasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to\ntoken-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup\nin inference.
