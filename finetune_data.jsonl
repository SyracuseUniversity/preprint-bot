{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Bremsstrahlung emission from nuclear reactions in compact stars':\n\nIntroduction:\nLight from stars provides us a main information about them. Here, photons emitted due to processes with partic-\nipation of elementary particles in stellar medium have been studied the most intensively. But, we know that stars\nhave nuclei from the lightest up to heavy (for example, see Chapter IV in book [1] for nuclei in Sun). Stability of\ncalculations of the bremsstrahlung spectra is achieved, if to take into account space regions up to atomic shells and\nlarger, even for low energies. This indicates on importance to study nucleus as unite system of evolving nucleons,\nwhich should be studied via solution of many body quantum mechanical problem, where interactions cannot be small\nand study cannot be reduced to perturbation approaches. So, important ingredient is emission of photons from stars\nproduced in nuclear reactions with participation of nuclei, from the lightest up to heavy. Bremsstrahlung emission of\nphotons during nuclear reactions in dense stellar medium has not been studied deeply and, so, it is a topic of current\npaper.\nStudy of nuclear forces [2, 3] in extreme conditions enlarges our possibilities to understand them deeper, where stars\nis a good laboratory for investigations [4\u20136]. Quantum nature of nuclear interactions can be displayed in possibility\nof nucleons to combine as bound system, i.e. atomic nucleus, characterized via binding energy. Many-nucleon uni\ufb01ed\ntheories of nucleus and nuclear reactions (for example, see microscopic cluster models based on developments of\nresonating group method [7\u20139] and generator coordinate method [10]), shell models, collective models, relativistic\nmean-\ufb01eld (RMF) theory [11\u201323], Ab initio calculations theory [24], QCD approaches for systems of nucleons, quark\nmodels (quark-meson models [26], potential models) have been constructed for study of nuclei. In stars, a main focus is\ngiven to obtain equation of state of matter (for example, see [25]). Naturally, many from models above are generalized\nfor such a task (for example, see Refs. [27\u201330] for RMF theories, see Ref. [25] for Ab initio calculations theory, etc.).\nToday, one of the most accepted models is APR (Akmal, Pandharipande, Ravenhall) model [31] constructed in some\nvariants (see also Refs. [32\u201335]). It is based on principles of quantum mechanics and can be related with many-nucleon\nmodels indicated above.\nIn this paper we are interesting in di\ufb00erent question, that is about ability of nuclear forces to keep nucleons as bound\nsystem inside star at high densities of stellar medium. In particular, it would be interesting to see how such property\nof nuclear forces is changed in dependence on location of nucleus inside star, and at change of density (gravity) of star.\nAs it was demonstrated in Ref. [36, 37], even for the same full wave functions with the same boundary conditions there\nare di\ufb00erent nuclear processes (with the same nuclei and energies) where di\ufb00erence in cross-sections of them can reach\n\u2217Electronic address: maidan@kinr.kiev.ua\n\u2020Electronic address: konstiger1998@live.com\n2\nup to 3-4 times. RMF theories cannot explain such fully quantum phenomenon, which is not small and important for\nunderstanding nuclear processes. By such a motivation, we would like to use basis of quantum mechanics for analysis\nin this paper.1 We use compact stars (stars at densities from white dwarf to neutron star [39]) in analysis. It turns\nout that model of deformed oscillators shells [40\u201343] is enough convenient for such a research (see straightforward\ninvestigations in many nucleon formalism [44\u201348] for basics of the model for the binary cluster con\ufb01gurations for light\nnuclei, [48\u201351] for its extensions to describe binary clusters coupled to collective channels, [52\u201355, 57] for three-cluster\ncon\ufb01gurations, [58\u201360] for newest developments). After calculations, solution can be obtained in exact analytical form\nwith included additional in\ufb02uence of stellar medium. We apply this simpli\ufb01ed model for estimations of emission of\nbremsstrahlung photons during scattering of protons o\ufb00nuclei in compact stars. We study how emission is changed\nin dependence of characteristics of stellar medium.\nThe paper is organized by the following way. In Sec. II and III we present model in estimating binding energy for\nlight nuclei, and in\ufb02uence of stellar medium in frameworks of polytropic model of star. Analysis of change of binding\nenergy of nuclei in stars is given in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we study emission of bremsstrahlung photons during scattering\nof protons o\ufb00nuclei from stellar medium of compact stars. We summarize conclusions in Sect. VI. Derivation of\ncorrection of energy of nucleus due to in\ufb02uence of stellar medium is presented in Appendix A.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this paper we investigate ability (role) of nuclear forces to combine nucleons as bound nuclear system in de-\npendence on its deep location inside the compact star. In order to perform such a research, we generalize the model\nof deformed oscillator shells [40, 41, 43] with two nucleon forces with new inclusion of additional in\ufb02uence of stellar\nmedium. We have obtained new simple exact formulas of energy for the lightest even-even nuclei, that is convenient\nfor analysis of stellar in\ufb02uence on binding energy of nuclei. As studied star, polytropic stars at n = 3 with densities\n13\ncharacterized from white dwarf to neutron star were included to analysis.\nWe observe a phenomenon of dissociation of nucleus \u2014 its disintegration on individual nucleons, starting from\nsome critical distance between this nucleus and center of star with high density. We explain this phenomenon by the\nfollowing logic. Forces of stellar medium press on nucleons of nucleus. The deeper this nucleus is located in star, the\nstronger such forces press on nucleus. However, binding energy (it is negative for nucleus in the external layer of star)\nis increased at deeper location of this nucleus in star. Starting from some critical distance from nucleus to center\nof star, the binding energy becomes positive (see Fig. 4). This means that full energy of individual nucleons of the\nstudied nucleus is already larger than mass of this nucleus, i.e. we obtain unbound system of nucleons and nucleus is\ndisintegrated on nucleons. According to estimations, we observe such a phenomenon in neutron stars, while in white\ndwarfs its is not observed. We have estimated such a critical distance for nucleus 4He in dependence on density at\ncenter of neutron star (see Fig. 5), where disintegration of this nucleus on nucleons takes place. The kinetic energy\nis increased at deeper location of nucleus in star. At decreasing distance from the studied nucleus to center of star,\nchange of kinetic energy is unlimited, while change of nuclear energy is limited. So, ratio between kinetic energy of\nnucleons of nucleus and nuclear energy of nucleus is changed also.\nBasing on the model above, we have generalized the bremsstrahlung formalism [62, 63] (see also improvements of\nthis formalism in Refs. [64\u201368]) for scattering of protons o\ufb00nuclei in compact stars. Using such a new model, we \ufb01nd\nthe following. (1) In the white dwarfs, in\ufb02uence of stellar medium imperceptibly a\ufb00ects on emission of bremsstrahlung\nphotons. This means that we have enough accurate description of emission of bremsstrahlung photons during nuclear\nreactions in Sun, white dwarfs and similar stars. (2) For neutron stars, in\ufb02uence of stellar medium is essentially more\nintensive and it crucially changes shape of the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung photons. Maximum of probability\nof the emitted photons is for their energy, which is half of energy of the scattered protons: Eph \u2243Ep/2. The most\nintensive emission is created in the bowel of the star, while the weakest emission is from the periphery (for the same\nenergy of the scattered proton).\nSummarizing, we \ufb01nd the model of deformed oscillator shells as convenient and not complicated technically basis\nfor obtaining clear understanding about di\ufb00erent forces and emission of bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions\nin compact stars.\nAcknowledgements\nS.

Accordingly, over the\npast decades much work has been focused on identifying the properties of a star that\nbest reveal its age. For coeval populations of stars in clusters, the most reliable ages are\ndetermined by \ufb01tting model isochrones to single cluster members in the color-magnitude\ndiagram. However, for the vast majority of stars not in clusters (unevolved late-type\n\ufb01eld stars), ages determined using the isochrone method are highly uncertain because\nthe primary age indicators are nearly constant throughout their main-sequence lifetimes,\nand because their distances and thus luminosities are poorly known. Therefore, \ufb01nding a\ndistance-independent property of individual stars that can act as a reliable determinant\nof their ages will be of great value.\nStellar rotation (and the related measure of chromospheric activity - see paper by\nMamajek this volume) has emerged as a promising and distance- independent indicator\nof age (e.g. Skumanich 1972; Kawaler 1989; Barnes 2003, 2007). Skumanich (1972) \ufb01rst\nestablished stellar rotation as an astronomical clock by relating the average projected\nrotation velocity in young open clusters to their ages via the expression v sin i \u221dt\u22120.5.

Rotation periods for stars in open clusters are essential\nto determine the relations between stellar age, rotation, and mass (color).\nUntil recently, ambiguities in vsini data and lack of cluster membership\ninformation, prevented a clear empirical definition of the dependence of\nrotation on color. Direct measurements of stellar rotation periods for members\nin young clusters have now revealed a well-defined period-color relation. We\nshow new results for the open clusters M35 and M34. However, rotation periods\nbased on ground-based observations are limited to young clusters. The Hyades\nrepresent the oldest coeval population of stars with measured rotation periods.\nMeasurements of rotation periods for older stars are needed to properly\nconstrain the dependence of stellar rotation on age.

According to accepted evo-\nlutionary scenarios, the Algol\u2013type binaries forms by mass transfer from initially more massive star\nto less massive, leading to the reversal of the initial mass ratio of the binary. This provide a unique\nopportunity to look into stellar interiors and to observer the remnant products of past core hydrogen\nburning.

Those oscillatory modes\nare classi\ufb01ed according to different restoring forces. The study of Coriolis restored r-mode in\nneutron stars has generated tremendous interest in recent times [1]. The mode becomes unstable\ndue to gravitational radiation. R-modes of rotating neutron stars are important sources of detectable\ngravitational waves. The l = m = 2 r-mode frequency (\u03c9r) is related to the angular frequency of\nthe compact star as \u03c9r =\n2m\nl(l+1)\u2126[1]. The calculation of \u2126depends on the equation of state (EoS)\nas it will be shown in Figure 3.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Origin of Europa and the Galilean Satellites':\n\nIntroduction:\nEuropa belongs to the family of four Galilean satellites, which each have similar masses, \nand orbits that are prograde, nearly circular, and approximately co-planar.  These basic properties \nsuggest that the Galilean satellites formed contemporaneously within a shared circumplanetary \ndisk orbiting within Jupiter\u2019s equatorial plane.  The conditions in this early disk established the \nsatellites\u2019 initial masses, compositions, and thermal and orbital states.  Observed properties of the \nGalilean satellites can provide constraints on this formation environment, which in turn can \nprovide clues to the conditions of Jupiter\u2019s formation.   \nRegular satellites originate from material in circumplanetary orbit, which can arise from a \nnumber of diverse processes (e.g., Pollack et al., 1991).  A large collision into a solid planet can \nproduce an impact-generated disk or in some cases an intact satellite (e.g., Canup, 2004, 2005).  \nAlthough an impact origin is typically implicated for the Earth\u2019s Moon and Pluto\u2019s Charon, this \nseems an unlikely explanation for the Galilean satellites given Jupiter\u2019s small ~ 3\u00b0 obliquity.  \nCollisions between objects in solar orbit that occur relatively close to a planet can also leave \nmaterial in planetary orbit, in a process known as co-accretion (e.g., Safronov et al., 1986).   \nForming the Galilean satellites by co-accretion is quite difficult, primarily because the rate of \nsuch collisions is generally low and captured material tends to not have enough net angular \nmomentum to account for the current satellite orbits (Estrada and Mosqueira, 2006).   \nFor gas planets, two processes are thought to be effective means for producing \ncircumplanetary disks of gas (H + He) and solids (rock + ice).   When a gas giant undergoes \nrunaway gas accretion, it expands to nearly fill the entire region within which its gravity \ndominates over that of the Sun, known as the planet\u2019s Hill sphere.  For Jupiter\u2019s distance and \ncurrent mean density, the Hill sphere of a planet is more than 700 times the planet\u2019s radius.  A \nforming gas planet will begin to contract within its Hill sphere once the rate of its gas accretion \ncan no longer compensate for the increasing rate of its gravitational contraction due to the \nplanet\u2019s growing mass and luminosity.  Accreted gas delivers angular momentum to the planet, \nand as the spinning planet contracts, conservation of angular momentum dictates that its rate of \nrotation increases.  When this rate reaches the critical rate for rotational instability, the planet\u2019s \nouter equatorial layers begin to shed, forming a so-called \u201cspin-out\u201d disk.   A second means for \nforming a disk occurs if the solar nebula is still present during the contraction phase, so that \nwhile the planet contracts, it is also continuing to accrete gas.   As the planet becomes smaller \n \n3\nand smaller, at some point the gas inflowing from solar orbit contains too much angular \nmomentum to allow it to fall directly onto the planet.  Instead, gas flows into orbit around the \nplanet and directly creates a disk (e.g., Figure 1).  Such a structure is known in astrophysical \ncontexts as an \u201caccretion\u201d disk.   \nWhether the Galilean satellites formed in a spin-out or an accretion disk depends on the \nrelative timing of Jupiter\u2019s contraction and the dispersal of the solar nebula.  Recent models (e.g., \nPapaloizou and Nelson, 2005) predict that a Jupiter-mass planet will contract to within the \ncurrent orbit of Io in less than a million years, while estimates of the lifetime of the solar nebula \nare longer, ~ 106 to 107 yr (e.g., Haisch et al., 2001).  Thus it appears probable that an accretion \ndisk would have predominated during the final stages of Jupiter\u2019s formation.    \nThe implication is that the Galilean satellites formed in a primordial gas disk surrounding \nJupiter, some millions to perhaps ten million years after the origin of the first solar system solids.  \nThe Jovian circumplanetary disk has often been viewed as analogous to the circumsolar disk, and \nin many respects the growth of satellites within this \u201cmini solar system\u201d would proceed similarly \nto the well-studied growth of solid planets from the nebular disk.  Collisions between orbiting \nobjects would lead to growth of progressively larger bodies.  Interactions between growing \nsatellites and the gas disk would modify their orbits, generally causing them to become more \ncircular and co-planar, and then on longer timescales to spiral inward toward the planet.  \nHowever, a fundamental difference between satellite and planet growth is that the satellite \nformation environment around a gas planet is coupled to and regulated by the evolution of the \nplanet and the surrounding solar nebula.   This leads to disk conditions that are not adequately \ndescribed as simply a scaled-down version of the solar nebula, a theme that will be emphasized \nhere.   \nIn this chapter, we focus on a relatively recent model (Canup and Ward, 2002, 2006; \nWard and Canup, in preparation) in which the Galilean satellites form within a gaseous accretion \ndisk produced at the very end of Jupiter\u2019s own accretion (e.g., Figure 2).  In this construct, the \ndisk is actively supplied by an ongoing inflow of gas and small solids to circumjovian orbit as \nsatellites are forming.  Disk conditions evolve in a quasi-steady state fashion in response to the \nevolution of Jupiter\u2019s own state and the rate of its gas accretion.  This leads to lower disk gas \ndensities and/or temperatures at the time of Galilean satellite formation than assumed in prior \nworks.  Within the disk, orbiting solids accumulate into satellites.  Satellite growth rates are \n \n4\ngoverned by the rate of delivery of solid particles from solar orbit, which leads to orders-of-\nmagnitude slower satellite accretion than typically predicted by models that consider a static \nrather than an actively supplied disk.  We envision that Jupiter had a circumplanetary disk for an \nextended time period, and that it is probable that a total mass of nebular gas and solids much \nlarger than the amount needed to form the Galilean satellites would have been processed through \nthis disk.  As satellites grow to masses comparable to those of the Galilean satellites, their \ngravitational interactions with the gas disk can cause their orbits to spiral inward towards the \nplanet.  Earlier generations of satellites at Jupiter may have formed and been lost to collision \nwith Jupiter, with the Galilean satellites we see today representing the last surviving generation \nof Jovian satellites that formed as gas inflow to the planet ended.     \nIn Section 2, we begin by outlining key constraints on Galilean satellite origin that arise \nfrom the properties of the satellites themselves.  We then describe the development and expected \ncharacteristics of a circumplanetary disk in the context of Jupiter\u2019s mass accretion and \ncontraction (Section 3).  In Section 4 we discuss the expected conditions within the disk at the \ntime of the Galilean satellites\u2019 formation, as well as models of the growth (and loss) of large \nsatellites within such a disk.  Section 5 reviews primary outstanding issues and areas requiring \nfuture research, and in Section 6 we outline potential implications for Europa\u2019s origin.   \nThe formation of the Galilean satellites has been discussed in many other review \nchapters, including Stevenson et al. (1986), Coradini et al. (1989), Pollack et al. (1991), Peale \n(1999), Lunine et al. (2004), McKinnon (2007), Peale (2008) and the Estrada et al. chapter in \nthis volume.  The reader is referred to these reviews for other viewpoints on this topic.\n\nConclusion:\nThe accretion disk model reviewed here has a number of strengths.  It describes satellite \nformation as a natural consequence of Jupiter\u2019s formation.  Provided the planet contracted before \nnebular dissipation was complete, a circumplanetary accretion disk is expected, based on \nanalytical estimates of the expected angular momentum of inflowing gas and on results of \nhydrodynamic simulations.  If the disk is viscous, the outward angular momentum transport \nrequired to allow gas to be accreted by the planet is achieved.  Between the period of peak \nrunaway gas inflow expected for a gas giant planet and the cessation of gas accretion, inflow \nrates to the circumjovian disk would slow, allowing for disk temperatures low enough for ice \nstability in the general region of Ganymede and Callisto, with ice accretion at Europa\u2019s location \npossible late in the satellite\u2019s growth.  The slow inflow rates needed for ice-rich satellites in turn \nimply that the Galilean satellites would have accreted slowly, in keeping with conditions needed \nfor a Callisto-sized satellite to avoid melting and differentiation as it forms.  Estimates of the \naverage specific angular momentum of inflowing gas are broadly consistent with the radial scale \nof the Galilean system.  Direct accretion simulations show the formation of Galilean-like satellite \n \n42\nsystems for a range of disk and inflow parameters, and suggest that Type I migration would \nregulate gas planet satellite systems to contain a common fraction of the planet\u2019s mass, \nindependent of the total mass processed through the protosatellite disk.  This offers an attractive \nexplanation for the similarity of the Galilean and Saturnian satellite system masses compared to \ntheir planet\u2019s mass.   \nHowever, some aspects of the accretion disk model are not well understood.  Foremost is \nthe origin of viscosity in the protosatellite disk, and indeed the origin of viscosity in the cool \nand/or dusty regions of the surrounding circumsolar disk as well.  It is generally accepted that \nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly magnetized disks drives turbulence and outward \nangular momentum transport, with effective \u03b1-values ~ 10-2 to 0.1 (Balbus and Hawley, 1991).  \nTo be operative, MRI requires a minimum ionization fraction, which can be produced thermally \n(for temperatures in excess of ~ 103 K), by galactic cosmic-rays (for regions of low gas surface \ndensity with \n2\n2\n10 g/cm\ng\n\u03c3 <\n, e.g., Dullemond et al. 2007), or by stellar X-rays (e.g., Glassgold et \nal., 1997).  However, the presence of dust grains can deactivate MRI because they are effective \ncharge absorbers and can cause the ionization fraction to plummet (Sano et al. 2000).  It is thus \nplausible that both the protosatellite disk and the circumsolar disk at Jupiter\u2019s distance would \nhave been \u201clayered\u201d: comprised of MRI \u201cactive\u201d regions at the disk surfaces, together with a \nneutral, dust-rich \u201cdead zone\u201d surrounding the disk mid-plane (e.g., Gammie, 1996).  It is \nchallenging to determine the exact vertical and radial extent of the inner dead zone, because this \ndepends on the disk chemistry and the dust grain size distribution (e.g., Semenov et al., 2004), \nhowever it is possible that in a gas-starved protosatellite disk the active region could be \nsubstantial, and this merits investigation. \nNon-magnetic hydrodynamic mechanisms have also been proposed as sources of \nturbulence and viscous transport in neutral disks, including notably those that rely on non-\naxisymmetric effects, including decaying vorticies (e.g., Lithwick, 2007), baroclinic instability \n(Klahr and Bodenheimer, 2003), and shear instability (Dubrulle et al. 2005).  Recent \nexperimental results claim to rule out angular momentum transport via axisymmetric \nhydrodynamical turbulence at levels corresponding to \u03b1 > 10-5 (Hantao et al., 2006).  \nGravitational torques from objects accreting within the disk may provide an effective viscosity \n(Goodman and Rafikov, 2001; see also Canup and Ward, 2002).  In the specific context of an \nactively supplied accretion disk, the shock front resulting from the difference in the free-fall \n \n43\nvelocity of mass infalling to the disk and that of the orbiting gas is another potential source of \nturbulence and therefore viscosity (Cassen and Moosman, 1981).  Such an inflow-driven \nviscosity would cease once the inflow had stopped completely, but it is possible that the last \nremaining orbiting gas could be then removed either by other sources of viscosity, e.g. by MRI \nonce small grains have been removed through accretion onto the satellites.  Spiral shocks \ngenerated by the inflowing gas may also drive angular momentum transport (Lubow et al., 1999), \nalthough such shocks appear weaker in 3D simulations than in 2D simulations (Bate et al., \n2003).  \nAnother area of uncertainty is the nature of the inflowing material. Hydrodynamical \nsimulations clearly show the formation of a viscous circumplanetary disk (e.g., Fig. 1 from Bate \net al., 2003). A key open issue is the average  specific angular momentum of the inflowing \nmaterial (which controls ro), as well as how the inflow varies with distance from the planet.  \nD\u2019Angelo et al. (2003) find a peak specific angular momentum of circumplanetary material about \n2.6 times larger than that of material orbiting Jupiter at Callisto\u2019s distance.  In contrast, \nsimulations by Machida et al. (2008) and Machida (2008) that resolve Jupiter\u2019s Hill sphere with \nmuch higher resolution find an average inflow specific angular momentum comparable to that at \nCallisto\u2019s orbit, or \n~ 22\no\nJ\nr\nR .  Machida (2008) argues that this result is unaffected by the more \nlocal nature of the Machida et al. simulations.  Further work is needed to address this important \nissue.  The mass fraction of gas vs. solid particles in the inflow (the \u201cf\u201d parameter) is highly \nuncertain, and is likely to remain so.  The predicted fraction of nebular solids contained in small \nparticles as a function of time is inherently model-dependent, as is the rate of nebular dispersal \nand therefore the nebular gas surface density as a function of time.  This means that both the \nnumerator and denominator needed to estimate the ratio f are poorly constrained, with a wide \nrange of values possible.   \nIt has been suggested that a region at the outer edge of Jupiter\u2019s gap\u2014within which there \nwould be a positive gradient in gas density with orbital radius\u2014may frustrate the delivery of \nsmall particles to Jupiter. Rice et al. (2006) argue that outward gas drag of small particles across \nthis region would prevent all but very small dust particles from reaching the planet.  However, \nthis implies that small particles will build-up at a preferred location at the gap\u2019s outer edge.   \nOnce the local particle density exceeds that of the gas, the particle drift rate will drop rapidly \n(e.g., Nakagawa et al., 1986), making it more difficult to prevent particle diffusion into the \n \n44\nplanet\u2019s gap.  This could result in a quasi-steady state flow interior to the region of particle build-\nup that has a similar solids content as that of the global disk flow, alleviating the problem.  \nAssessing whether this occurs will require models that incorporate the effects of particle \nconcentration.  It is also possible that strong turbulence concentrated at the gap edges (e.g., \nWard, in preparation) will weaken such efficient particle filtering by gas-drag.  \nThe accretion simulations of Canup and Ward (2006) found that overall outcomes were \nrather weakly dependent of the ratio of (\u03b1/f), a fortuitous result given the uncertainties in both of \nthese quantities discussed above.  However, the smallest sized particles in the Canup and Ward \nsimulations were ~ 102 km-scale due to computational limitations, so that the regime of small \nparticle growth was not resolved.  Future work should address this regime, and in particular the \nconditions in which particle accretion can occur faster than particle loss due to aerodynamic gas \ndrag.  The potential role of other solid delivery mechanisms in the context of an inflow-supplied \naccretion disk, including gas drag and collisional capture, should also be assessed.  \n \n6 \nIMPLICATIONS \nIn the past two decades there have been important advances in our understanding of \nsatellite properties, gas giant planet formation, and planet and satellite migration processes.  This \nchapter has focused on a model motivated in part by such advances, in which Europa and the \nother Galilean satellites form within a gas-starved accretion disk produced during the final stages \nof Jupiter\u2019s own gas accretion.  Compared to the pioneering models developed in the 1980\u2019s, \nincluding most notably the work of Lunine and Stevenson (1982), the slow-inflow accretion disk \nconstruct implies notably different conditions for the disk environment in which Europa formed \nand for the nature of satellite accretion around gas planets.  We here conclude by outlining \noverall implications of the Canup and Ward (2002, 2006) model. \n1) Satellite migration and loss.  If more than ~ 2% of Jupiter\u2019s mass in solar-\ncomposition material was processed through its accretion disk\u2014which seems \nlikely\u2014multiple generations of satellites may have formed and ultimately been lost to \nType I migration and collision with Jupiter.  The Galilean satellites are then the last \nsurviving generation, and their properties reflect conditions that existed as gas inflow \nto Jupiter was ending.   \n \n45\n2) Maximum satellite mass and a common total satellite system mass.   Type I migration \nprecludes the formation of satellites larger than a critical mass, and  causes the total \nsatellite system mass to maintain a relatively constant value.   While detailed \ncharacteristics of satellite systems of gas giants would vary, those that formed from \naccretion disks would be predicted to display a similar largest satellite mass and \nsatellite system mass compared to their host planet\u2019s mass.   \n3) Late formation times.  The growth of Europa and the other Galilean satellites is \npredicted to be concurrent with the dissipation of the solar nebula.  This is likely to \nhave occurred several million years or more after the formation of the earliest solar \nsystem solids, based on several lines of reasoning.  Forming Jupiter via core accretion \nappears to require a few to ~ 5 million years (Hubickyj et al. 2005), and observations \nof disks around other stars find a mean nebular lifetime of 3 Myr (Haisch et al. 2001).  \nThe requirement that Callisto did not melt as it formed implies that the satellites \nfinished their accretion no earlier than about 4 Myr after CAI\u2019s (Barr and Canup, \n2008).  These age estimates suggest that short-lived radioisotopes would have been \nrelatively unimportant by the time the Galilean satellites accreted.   \n4) Low gas disk densities, low disk pressures.  Accretion disks produced during the end \nstages of Jupiter\u2019s growth have low gas densities and pressures not too different from  \nthat of the background solar nebula.  Infalling solid particles would therefore undergo \nlittle additional chemical processing, and their composition would be expected to \ngenerally reflect solar nebula conditions (e.g., Mousis and Alibert, 2006).  This \ncontrasts to the dense and high-pressure disks implied by MMSN models, which \nimplied substantial chemical alteration of disk material (e.g., Prinn and Fegley, \n1981).   \n5) Protracted satellite accretion.  The slow inflow rates required for temperatures low \nenough for ices in the Ganymede and Callisto region imply that the Galilean satellites \naccreted slowly, taking 105 to 106 yr to acquire their final masses for a solar \ncomposition inflow.  Such long accretion times are also generally consistent with \nthose needed for Callisto to avoid melting as it accreted.  In contrast, traditional \nMMSN models predict much more rapid satellite accretion in \u2264 104 yrs. \n \n46\n6) Accretion by predominantly small impactors.  Small particles delivered to the disk \nwith the inflow will grow until their mutual collision timescale is comparable to their \ncollision timescale with the dominant large satellite in their region of the disk.  This \nbalance yields a predicted characteristic impactor size of about a kilometer or less for \nthe Galilean satellites (Barr and Canup, 2008).  However episodic collisions between \nlarge migrating satellites are possible.    \n7) Possible primordial establishment of Laplace resonance.  The Galilean satellites \nwould have likely migrated inward somewhat during their formation.  Ganymede\u2019s \nlarger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa and \nIo.  Peale and Lee (2002) have shown that it is possible that in such a situation to \nestablish the Laplace resonance from outside-in during the satellite formation era.  \n8) Heterogeneous accretion of Europa.  Disk temperatures near Europa\u2019s orbit are \npredicted to have been too warm for ices during much of the satellite\u2019s growth, so that \nmost of Europa would have accreted as a purely rocky object.  But during the final \nstages of Europa\u2019s accretion, the ice line likely moved within the satellite\u2019s orbit, so \nthat the final ~ 10% of its accreted mass would have been a mixture of rock and ice.   \n \n47\n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Anisotropic distribution functions for spherical galaxies':\n\nIntroduction:\nThere is a long history of studying the structure of galaxies by construction of self-consistent distribution func-\ntions for a stellar system with a known gravitational potential. The potential of the system determines the self-\nconsistent mass density \u03c1 of the system via Poisson\u2019s equation generated by the well-known Newtonian gravita-\ntional law, and also the structure of the stellar orbits according to Newton\u2019s equations of motion. The system is\nconstructed from the building blocks of the orbits that can lie within the potential. This is called the \u201cfrom \u03c1 to\nf\u201d approach for \ufb01nding a self-consistent distribution function f (Binney and Tremaine 1987, hereafter BT). The\ndistribution function (hereafter DF) of the system represents how stars are distributed in the phase space of the\nsystem and the integration of the DF over velocity space yields the density. Therefore the problem of \ufb01nding the\nDF is that of solving an integral equation; in the spherical case in particular this equation is of the \ufb01rst kind, in\nwhich the unknown DF f only occurs inside the integral.\nSome outstanding astronomers have contributed to this mathematical problem. Eddington (1916) showed\nthat it can be solved for an isotropic DF that depends only on the energy in the spherical case, whose velocity\ndispersions in the radial and tangential directions must be equal, by \ufb01rst expressing the density as a function\nonly of the potential, and then solving the Abel integral equation. It is also well known that the isotropic DF is\nunique for the potential of any spherical system.\nFricke\u2019s (1952) expansion method can be obviously generalized to the spherical case (e.g., Camm 1952;\nBouvier 1962, 1963; Ossipkov 1979a; Kent and Gunn 1982; Dejonghe 1986, 1987; Dejonghe and Merritt 1988;\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough real galaxies are hardly spherically symmetric, it is a very necessary and signi\ufb01cant step to study the\nself-consistent anisotropic DFs for stellar systems with the known spherically symmetric density. This is not\nonly because some important properties (e.g. surface density and cumulative mass) of the spherical model are\nsimilar to those of the models that can be generated from the spherically symmetric density by replacing the\nspherical radius r by an axisymmetric or triaxial radius m =\np\nx2 +(y/q2)2 +(z/q3)2, but also because both\nspherical and non-spherical models have the same typical behaviours of the dynamical quantities in the limits\nof small and large radii. Such models are elliposoidal. Other classes of \ufb02attened models can be constructed by\nusing the equipotential method (e.g., Kutusov and Ossipkov 1980; Jiang 2000).\nAnisotropic DFs can be obtained for stellar systems with known spherically symmetric density as a sum of\nproducts of functions only of the potential and a special function (or power) only of the radial coordinate, i.e.\nthese DFs are a sum of products of functions only of a special variable (or the energy) and a power only of the\nmagnitude of the angular momentum. This comes from a combination of the ideas of Eddington and Fricke.\nIt is an extension of Eddington\u2019s classical solution for the isotropic DF of a known spherical density. Like his\nmethod, it requires that the density be expressed as a special function of the potential, and now also of the radial\ncoordinate. Also, part of it is a sum of real integrals of functions only of the potential. Most of these integrals\n12\nZ. Jiang, L. Ossipkov\ncan be calculated analytically in terms of elementary functions or generalized hypergeometric functions (e.g.\nKuzmin and Veltmann 1967b).\nThese formulae concerning anisotropic DFs are obtained by use of the Abel integral equation, and they are\nsuitable for all such densities that allow the real integrals of the potential to be valid. The anisotropic DFs of\nOssipkov-Merritt type are their examples in special cases. After the application to Plummer\u2019s spherical model,\nit is found that the anisotropic DFs given by (29) are in fact the same as those given by Dejonghe (1986). Three\ndifferent anisotropic DFs are given for H\u00b4enon\u2019s (1959a, b) isochrone model and they can be expressed in terms\nof elementary functions. Many anisotropic DFs of \u03b3-models, expressed in elementary functions or generalized\nhypergeometric functions, can also be obtained. One can further give formulae of the velocity dispersions for\nthese anisotropic DFs.\nThese expressions can be extended further to axisymmetric systems. It is straightforward to \ufb01nd their ana-\nlogues for axisymmetric systems and they can be used to obtain the even DF of Binney\u2019s (BT) logarithmic\npotential although Evans (1993) derived it using Lynden-Bell\u2019s (1962) method. For the well-known Lynden-Bell\n(1962) model, these analogues degenerate into the method of Fricke (1952).\nAcknowledgements The \ufb01rst author was supported in part by NSFC 10271121 and by SRF for ROCS, SEM.

The tracks\nof the Geneva group (Schaller et al. 1992, Meynet et al. 1994,\nnon-rotating tracks of Meynet & Maeder 2003) produce more\nand cooler red supergiants at young ages (6\u201320Myr) than those\nof the Padova group, used here. Near-IR models based on the\nGeneva tracks may well be able reconcile the optical and near-\nIR ages of cluster M82-1a. Stronger red supergiant contribu-\ntions are also obtained at a variety of ages with tracks that\nassume newborn stars rotate (Meynet & Maeder 2000, 2003;\nV\u00b4azquez et al. 2007). Along rotating tracks, the stars tend to\nspend more time in redder parts of the HR-diagram, the red su-\npergiants evolve at higher luminosities and lower (average) sur-\nface gravities, and they have strongly enhanced surface abun-\ndances of nitrogen. Both optical and near-IR studies would be\na\ufb00ected by these changes.\nThe second model input of importance for stellar popula-\ntion synthesis is the spectral library. In Sect. 2.1, we noted that\nuntil the stellar atmosphere models are able to properly repro-\nduce the extended spectra of individual red supergiants, the\nvalues of Te\ufb00and log(g) assigned to individual stars will re-\nmain uncertain. They are a\ufb00ected by metallicity, detailed sur-\nface abundances, microturbulence and other model atmosphere\ningredients. As an illustration of the sensitivity of age dating\ntechniques to these inputs we have computed SSP models in\nwhich the spectral sequences of Fig. 1 were shifted up (case A)\nor down (case B) in g (by 0.4 dex for class Ia, 0.2 dex for class\nIab). When assigned gravities are larger (case B; expected if\nmicroturbulent velocities are large), spectra of the more lumi-\nnous sequences are used with larger weights and over a larger\nrange of ages than when assigned gravities are small (case A).\nThe strongest e\ufb00ect is a prediction of stronger CN bands with\nlarger assigned gravities.\nWe confronted the resulting SSP spectra with observations\nof cluster F, for which the bluer parts of the near-IR spec-\ntrum (predominantly shaped by CN bands) indicated slightly\nyounger ages than the H and K band spectra (Fig. 12). This sit-\nuation suggested that models with stronger CN bands would\nprovide a better global \ufb01t. As expected, case B models led to a\nwavelength independent near-IR age of 25-30 Myr, while case\nA made it impossible to match CN and CO bands simultane-\nously.\nThis test shows that with the data quality achievable today\nwe are sensitive to spectral di\ufb00erences between luminosity sub-\nclasses, and it will be useful to continue to include this distinc-\ntion in future population synthesis models.\nThe derived ages are expected to be sensitive also to the\nadopted Te\ufb00scale. Assigned temperatures rise by up to 300 K\nwhen the microturbulence parameter is increased to 10 km s\u22121,\nbut (based on a very preliminary exploration of a new series of\ntheoretical spectra) they drop by similar amounts when switch-\ning from the solar abundances of Anders & Grevesse, used here\n(see LHLM07), to those of Asplund et al. (2005).\nIn view of the above, it is clear that it will be necessary\nto reassess the cluster data with a wider range of models. The\nlarge systematic errors due to the choice of a particular model,\nA. Lanc\u00b8on et al.: Near-IR spectroscopic ages of massive star clusters in M82.\n13\nwhich are not included in Table 2, can then be quanti\ufb01ed and\nreduced by selecting the subset of models providing satisfac-\ntory simultaneous \ufb01ts to both the optical and the near-IR data.\n5.2. Stochastic \ufb02uctuations\nThe issue of stochastic \ufb02uctuations is the result of the con-\ntrast between the small fractional number of bright stars in\na stellar population and their large contribution to the lumi-\nnosity (Girardi & Bica 1993, Santos & Frogel 1997, Lanc\u00b8on\n& Mouhcine 20003, Cervi\u02dcno & Luridiana 2006). Table 3 lists\nthe average relative and absolute numbers of red supergiant\nstars in synthetic single-age populations of total mass 106 M\u2299,\nas well as the contribution of these stars to the \ufb02ux at 1 \u00b5m\nand 2.2 \u00b5m. Note that these numbers depend on the shape of\nthe IMF. Poisson statistics tell us that the r.m.s dispersion in\nthe actual number of red supergiants between single clusters of\nthat mass equals the square root of the average number. In the\nK band, the red supergiants are so much more luminous than\nother coeval stars that these variations translate almost directly\ninto dispersions in the \ufb02uxes (Lanc\u00b8on & Mouhcine 2000). For\ncolours such as V-K or Z-K, \ufb02uctuations are also due partly to\nvarying numbers of luminous blue stars. When average num-\nbers are small (< 10), the predictions can be o\ufb00set from the\nmean or multimodal: the colours vary wildly depending on\nwhether or not a handful of massive stars happen to be in a\nred or in a blue phase of their evolution.\nTable 3 tells us it is necessary to work with clusters of\n\u223c106 M\u2299or more, if one wishes to test detailed model in-\ngredients (unless large samples of clusters are available for a\nstatistical analysis). For instance, at an age of 30 Myr a cluster\nof \u223c106 M\u2299will contain 260 \u00b1 16 red supergiants, that will\non average provide 85 % of the K band \ufb02ux. Clearly, the \u223c6 %\n\ufb02uctuations in the red supergiant numbers (combined with \ufb02uc-\ntuations in the numbers of blue stars) will produce a spread in\ncolours such as V-K that make it impossible to test the small\ndi\ufb00erences in average properties resulting from conservative\nchanges in the IMF.\nThe di\ufb00erences between evolutionary tracks are much\nlarger than those associated with changes in the IMF. We ex-\npect that at least some of these will be testable with individ-\nual clusters more massive than a few 105 M\u2299. Detailed com-\nputations with the various sets of tracks now available will be\nneeded in order to verify this statement. As a general rule, even\nwith masses around 106 M\u2299, the existence of the fundamental\nstochastic limitation must be kept in mind.\n6. Conclusion\nUsing new synthetic spectra of single stellar populations that\nextend to 2.5 \u00b5m and include red supergiant spectra at resolu-\ntion \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb \u2243750, we have analysed the near-IR spectra of a few\nof the most massive star clusters in the starburst galaxy M 82.\nWe demonstrate that very good \ufb01ts to all the near-IR photo-\nspheric features seen at this resolution can now be obtained. In\n3 On p. 35 in that article, divide by l instead of L in the second\nexpression given for \u03c3L/L.\nparticular, the new synthetic spectra can be used for a precise\nsubtraction of the stellar background in emission line studies.\nThe models also signi\ufb01cantly improve predictions of the low\nresolution energy distribution around 1 \u00b5m over those based on\nprevious stellar libraries. Further improvements around 1 \u00b5m\nare to be expected from the inclusion of stars warmer than\n5000 K in the library of near-IR spectra used here.\nBetween ages of 10 and 60 Myr, we have found that the\ndegeneracy between age and extinction is essentially perfect\nin near-IR broad band photometry (Z,Y,J,H,K), when the ex-\ntinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989) is used. A simultaneous\n\ufb01t of the near-IR spectra and the optical + near-IR energy dis-\ntribution was obtained for cluster M82-L, and this required a\nmodi\ufb01ed extinction law (e.g. the law of Cardelli et al., 1989,\nwith RV < 3.1). This new evidence for non-standard extinc-\ntion laws towards star clusters in starburst galaxies, which is\nnot surprising considering the very inhomogeneous spatial dis-\ntribution of the dust in these objects, is an additional di\ufb03culty\nin any attempt to derive ages from photometry alone. The use\nof extended spectra allows to constrain both the ages and the\nshape of the extinction law. It is worth recalling, however, that\na given shape of the extinction law can correspond to a vari-\nety of values of the total amount of obscuration (e.g. Witt &\nGordon 2000).\nA table of red supergiant numbers and \ufb02ux contributions\nhas been provided. We argue that the stochastic nature of the\nstellar mass function must be kept in mind at all cluster masses,\nbut that with masses above 105 M\u2299the analysis of individual\nextended spectra nevertheless allows us to test selected parame-\nters of the population synthesis models. For instance, we expect\nit will be possible to exploit the largest di\ufb00erences between var-\nious sets of current stellar evolution tracks (e.g. tracks for rotat-\ning and for non-rotationg stars). But we discourage attempts to\ntest the shape of the upper IMF unless cluster mass approaches\n106 M\u2299.\nThe absolute ages derived from the near-IR spectra depend\non model parameters that are still highly uncertain, to a large\npart because the physics of red supergiants (evolution, spec-\ntra) are particularly complex. More work on the stellar models\nand more confrontations with star cluster data will be needed.\nCare needs to be taken in matching the apertures of multi-\nwavelengths observations. It is promising that data quality now\nallows us to exploit \u201cdetails\u201d that were neglected until now,\nsuch as the di\ufb00erences between spectra of supergiants of class\nIa, Iab and Ib/II.\nThe near-IR ages found with the current model assumptions\nfor the observed IR-bright clusters in M 82 are concentrated be-\ntween 9 and 35 Myr. Indeed, their spectra display deep bands of\nCN and CO, and therefore favour the model ages at which the\ncontributions of luminous red supergiants are strongest. Cluster\nF, with weaker bands, is the oldest cluster of our sample. In\nmost cases, the near-IR molecular bands of the models at the\nages derived from optical studies are marginally acceptable or\ntoo weak. Changing the adopted evolutionary tracks or the pa-\nrameters assigned to the spectra of the input stellar library can\nresult in deeper near-IR bands over a wider range of ages. Work\nis in progress to perform these tests, which should in time al-\n14\nA. Lanc\u00b8on et al.: Near-IR spectroscopic ages of massive star clusters in M82.\nTable 3.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Untwisting magnetospheres of neutron stars':\n\nIntroduction:\nNeutron stars are highly conducting and strongly magnetized. Their extended magneto-\nspheres are anchored deep in the rigid crust and corotate with the star. The magnetosphere is\n1Also at Astro-Space Center of Lebedev Physical Institute, Profsojuznaja 84/32, Moscow 117810, Russia\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nusually assumed to be static in the co-rotating frame or evolving very slowly as the star ages.\nElectric currents are con\ufb01ned to a narrow bundle of open \ufb01eld lines that connect the star to\nits light cylinder (Goldreich & Julian 1969). The main, closed, part of the magnetosphere is\nusually assumed to be current-free and potential, \u2207\u00d7 B = 0.\nThe standard picture of a static potential magnetosphere is reasonable for ordinary\npulsars, yet apparently it does not describe all neutron stars. In particular, neutron stars\nwith ultrastrong \ufb01elds B >\u223c1014 G (magnetars) are inferred to have dynamic magnetospheres\n(see e.g. reviews by Woods & Thompson 2006; Kaspi 2007; Mereghetti 2008). Their activity\nis believed to be caused by crustal motions relieving internal stresses.1 In contrast to ordinary\npulsars, these objects show huge temporal variations in luminosity, spectrum, and spindown\nrate. Theoretically, stresses are expected to build up in the deep crust as the star ages\n(e.g. Ruderman 1991; Thompson & Duncan 1995). In particular, the large Ampere forces\nj \u00d7 B/c inside magnetars can break the crust and shear it in a catastrophic way.2 Such a\nstarquake twists the magnetic \ufb01eld anchored in the crust, creating \u2207\u00d7 B \u0338= 0 and inducing\nelectric currents in the closed magnetosphere (Thompson et al. 2000). The currents are\napproximately force-free and \ufb02ow along the magnetic \ufb01eld lines, j \u00d7 B = 0. They emerge\nfrom the deep crust sheared in the starquake.\nTwisted force-free magnetospheric con\ufb01gurations were studied extensively in the context\nof the solar corona, and these models can be applied to neutron stars. A simple example is the\nself-similarly twisted dipole. It was constructed by Wolfson (1995) and applied to neutron\nstars by Thompson, Lyutikov, & Kulkarni (2002). This and similar force-free con\ufb01gura-\ntions are magnetostatic solutions. A sequence of such con\ufb01gurations may be constructed by\nchanging their boundary conditions, i.e. displacing the footpoints of the magnetic \ufb01eld lines.\nIf the footpoints freeze, the con\ufb01guration freezes as well. At a \ufb01rst glance, this seems to\nsuggest that the implanted twist must freeze when the starquake ends, and wait for another\nstarquake.\nIn fact, the magnetosphere must evolve after the starquake, even though it remains\nanchored in the motionless deep crust. Indeed, energy is continually dissipated in the twisted\nmagnetosphere, because the twist current j = (c/4\u03c0)\u2207\u00d7 B is maintained by a voltage\n\u03a6e \u0338= 0 established along the magnetic \ufb01eld lines. Thompson et al. (2000) estimated voltage\n\u03a6e assuming that the currents are carried by electrons and ions lifted from the star\u2019s surface\nagainst gravity. Beloborodov & Thompson (2007; hereafter BT07) found that \u03a6e is regulated\n1Well-studied ordinary pulsars (Crab, Vela) also show glitches in their spindown rates, which are associ-\nated with sudden crustal deformations.\n\nConclusion:\nElectrodynamics of untwisting may be summarized as follows:\n1.\n\u2014 The twist evolution following a starquake is not di\ufb00usive spreading that was\npictured previously. Instead, the twist current is sucked into the star, a cavity immediately\nforms in the inner magnetosphere and grows until it erases all of the twist (Fig. 6). A sharp,\nstep-like drop in current density j is maintained at the boundary of the cavity. It is caused\nby the threshold nature of the discharge that conducts magnetospheric currents.\n2. \u2014 As the cavity expands and the j-bundle shrinks toward the magnetic axis, the\ntwist amplitude \u03c8 in the j-bundle can grow. The growth occurs if dV/du > 0, i.e. the\ndischarge voltage is smaller on \ufb01eld lines extending farther from the star. This is plausible\nif the current is conducted through e\u00b1 discharge.13 The j-bundle with the growing twist is\nshrinking faster with time, so that the total twist energy Etw decreases consistently with the\nOhmic dissipation rate.\n3. \u2014 The growing twist that has reached the threshold for instability \u03c8max = O(1)\nis expected to \u201cboil over\u201d and drive an intermittent out\ufb02ow of magnetic energy from the\nstar. The twist in the j-bundle then remains near \u03c8max for the rest of its lifetime. It may\nbe regulated by the limit-cycle instability \u2014 the repeated growth of \u03c8 to \u03c8max followed by\na sudden reduction of \u03c8 below \u03c8max. The value of \u03c8max and the nonlinear behavior of the\nouter magnetosphere at \u03c8 \u223c\u03c8max needs to be studied further using numerical simulations.\n4. \u2014 In addition to rare large starquakes, the magnetosphere can be gradually twisted\nby the continued motion of its footpoints, either plastic or through a sequence of small\nstarquakes. The continued footpoint motion leads to either a very strong twist or a tiny\n(negligible) twist that has no observational e\ufb00ects. A quasi-steady state with a non-negligible\ntwist amplitude is possible only with \u03c8 \u223c\u03c8max.\n13In contrast, if the current-carrying charges were lifted from the star by voltage (32), the voltage would\nbe larger for \ufb01eld lines that extend to larger altitudes, i.e. dV/du < 0. Then the twist on the j-bundle would\ndiminish with time rather than grow.\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nRecent observations of XTE J1810-197 are particularly useful for testing the untwisting\ntheory, for a few reasons: (1) XTE J1810-197 displayed a clean post-starquake evolution,\nwhich was observed for years uninterrupted by new starquakes. (2) The low level of quiescent\nluminosity from this object allows one to see clearly the shrinking hot spot on the star, and\nits evolving luminosity was tracked from 1035 erg/s down to 1033 erg/s. (3) The detection of\nradio pulsations and detailed measurements of spindown torque make this object yet more\ninteresting for testing theoretical models. For these reasons, this paper focused mainly on\nXTE J1810-197(\u00a7 7).\nRecently, an outburst was detected in the similar radio magnetar\n1E 1547.0-5408 (Camilo et al. 2008; Halpern et al. 2008). Its behavior appears to be more\ncomplicated than that of XTE J1810-197; apparently, episodes of repeated (and overlapping\nin time) activity occurred a few months after the outburst. The analysis of this object is\ndeferred to a future work.\nOther, more active, AXPs and SGRs display a diverse and complicated behavior of\nX-ray luminosity, pulse pro\ufb01le, and spindown rate (see Woods & Thompson 2006; Kaspi\n2007; Mereghetti 2008 for reviews). Repeated starquakes of various amplitudes and possible\nplastic deformations of the crust make these objects more di\ufb03cult to analyze. The continuing\ninjection of a magnetospheric twist can slow down the decay of its luminosity. It can also\na\ufb00ect the star\u2019s spindown in a more complicated way than described in \u00a7 6.3 for an isolated\nstarquake. In general, twist injection should lead to higher X-ray activity and faster spindown\n(Thompson et al.\n2002).\nSuch a general correlation exists in the magnetar population\n(Marsden & White 2001) but not always observed in individual objects. Note that spindown\nis controlled by the X-ray-dim bundle of open \ufb01eld lines. The impact of a starquake on\nthis narrow bundle may be immediate, occur with a delay, or never occur, depending on the\nstarquake geometry and amplitude (cf. the case of a \u201cring\u201d starquake in \u00a7 5.5). Repeated\nstarquakes may lead to a non-trivial relation between spindown and X-ray emission.\nDespite the diverse behavior of active magnetars, some general features may be inferred.\nIt is clear that the observed sources do not have strong global twists, for two reasons. First,\nthe evolution timescale of such twists would be too long, tev \u223c(10 \u2212102)V\u22121\n9\nyr, where\nV9 is the discharge voltage in units of 109 V (see eq. 50). In contrast, the magnetospheres\nof observed magnetars usually evolve on timescales \u223c1 yr or even shorter.14 Second, the\nluminosity produced by a strong global twist would be too high, L \u223c1037V9 erg s\u22121 (see\neq. 48). It is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the typical observed luminosities of magne-\n14The theoretical tev would be reduced for a larger discharge voltage V \u226b109 V, however it appears\nimpossible to sustain such a voltage as it leads to runaway e\u00b1 creation (BT07).\nEven if V \u226b109 V\nwere theoretically possible, strong global twists would still be ruled out by observations because they are\noverluminous.\n\u2013 42 \u2013\ntars, L \u223c1035 erg/s (e.g. Durant & van Kerkwijk 2006). This leaves two possibilities: the\ntwist is weak (\u03c8 \u226a1) or localized to a narrow bundle of \ufb01eld lines. The changing spindown\nrate suggests a strong twist, at least near the magnetic dipole axis. Thus, observations ap-\npear to support the picture of a strongly twisted j-bundle near the dipole axis. It is certainly\nsupported by the observations of XTE J1810-197 (\u00a7 7).\nThe localized strong twist may be created by starquakes localized to the polar region. It\nalso tends to form dynamically from a weak global twist as the j-bundle shrinks to the axis.\nThe luminosity and evolution timescale of an untwisting magnetosphere with u\u22c6= sin2 \u03b8\u22c6\u223c\n0.1 and \u03c8 \u223c1 is consistent with typical L \u223c1035 erg/s and tev \u223c1 yr of active magnetars\n(see eqs. 48 and 50). Both nonthermal X-ray components in the magnetar spectra, 1-20 keV\nand 20-300 keV, can be produced by the j-bundle. They are likely emitted at di\ufb00erent radii.\nIf the hard component is produced near the star, where the j-bundle is narrow, a relatively\nnarrow 20-300 keV pulse is expected.\nThe resonant-scattering model for 1-20 keV radiation is consistent with the picture of\na narrow j-bundle near the dipole axis. The cyclotron resonance for e\u00b1 with keV photons\ntakes place at radii r \u223c10R. This means that the resonant scattering is con\ufb01ned to the\n\ufb01eld-line bundle with u = R/Rmax \u223c0.1 (\u00a7 6.2). The luminosity of upscattered radiation\nLsc is supplied by Ohmic dissipation of electric currents in this bundle.\nThe footprints of a bundle with u \u223c0.1 form \u223c3 km spot on the star. A signi\ufb01cant\nfraction of energy released in the j-bundle may be transported to its footprints and emitted\nthere quasi-thermally. If the spot radiates a signi\ufb01cant part of the bundle luminosity, L \u223c\n1035 erg/s, then it must have a temperature kT \u22481 keV. Such hot spots were observed in\nXTE J1810-197 and 1E 1547.0-5408, but were not reported for other, brighter magnetars.\nThe typical reported temperatures of blackbody components are 0.3 \u22120.6 keV (e.g. Perna\net al. 2001).

We describe the properties of the radial and vertical\nepicyclic frequencies related to the oscillatory motion in the equatorial plane of the Kerr spacetimes. While\ntheir behaviour is qualitatively similar for Kerr and brany Kerr black holes, there are strong differences in\nthe case of naked singularities \u2013 in some range of their parameters, the vertical epicyclic frequency could be\neven lower than the radial one. Such a situation is impossible in standard Kerr spacetimes. Further, in the \ufb01eld\nof brany Kerr naked singularities, the structure of the radial pro\ufb01les is much richer than in the standard case,\nnamely the number of local extrema could be higher in comparison with the standard Kerr naked singularities.\nIn a special family of the brany naked singularity spacetimes, the radial epicyclic frequency has no zero point\nsince there is no marginally stable circular geodesic in these spacetimes.\nAssuming the parametric resonance acting directly between the oscillations with radial and vertical epicyclic\nfrequency [80], we give the rule for the resonant radius with a given frequency ratio. The rule is tested for the\nuppermost twin frequencies observed in the GRS 1915+105 microquasar; and limits on the spin and brany\nparameters are obtained and compared with the estimates for b = 0, given in [80].7 Further, it is shown that\nthe relativistic precession model [69] and the trapped oscillations of warped disc model [38,37] are not able\nto \ufb01t the observational data of GRS 1915+105, with high spin limits, as these two models work well for small\nor mediate black hole spin.\nIn the Galaxy center source Sgr A\u2217, three frequencies were reported [11,12,76,77] that could be treated\nin the scope of the strong resonance model. The model predicts an exact value of the black hole spin and puts\nlimits on its mass. It is shown that the black hole mass estimate given by the strong resonance model is in\nthe best agreement with the value of M \u223c3.7\u00d7 106 M\u2299[30] for negative brany parameter b \u223c\u22122.97, with\nthe \u201cmagic\u201d spin a \u22481.99. Generally, for negative values of b the \ufb01t of the model with observational data is\nbetter than for b = 0, while for positive values of b the inverse holds.\nOur resonance models could be to some extend applied to slowly rotating neutron stars, when the Kerr\nmetric could be relevant, and there are some indications that orbital resonance models could be relevant to\nexplain also the data from binary neutron star systems [78,85,82,79].\nWe can conclude that the orbital resonance model and its generalization to the multiresonant model is\nable to put some astrophysically interesting limits on the values of the brany parameter and could be useful in\nestimating in\ufb02uence of hypothetical external dimension to the properties of the brany universe.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the Czech grant MSM 4781305903.

The optical emission-line\nproperties of NLS1s can be summarized as (e.g., Osterbrock & Pogge 1985, Komossa 2008):\n(i) The Balmer lines are only slightly broader than the forbidden lines such as the [O III]\n\u03bb5007 (typically less than 2000 km s\u22121). (ii) The [O III] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2 intensity ratio is smaller\nthan 3. (iii) They present the strong Fe II emission which are often seen in Sy 1s but\ngenerally not in Sy 2\u2019s. Moreover, the X-ray spectra of NLS1\u2019s are very steep (e.g. Boller\net al. 1996, Leighly 1999ab) and highly variable (Boller et al. 1996; Leighly 1999a; Gliozzi\net al. 2007). Also, it was found that NLS1s have less massive black hole masses than Sy\n1s (Mathur 2000, Wang & Zhang 2007) and could be young Sy 1s (Botte et al. 2004).\nEven though NLS1s have been known for almost more than 20 years, it is still not clearly\nunderstood what NLS1s are in the context of the current AGN uni\ufb01ed model (Nagao et al.\n2001).\nOne of the interesting observational facts connected with NLS1 is that in their spectra\na strong Fe II emission is present. It was shown by Boroson & Green (1992) that a strong\nanti-correlation between the strengths of the [OIII] and Fe II line intensities exists in the\noptical spectra, where NLS1s are showing the strongest Fe II and weakest [OIII] emission.\nThe observed line widths and absence of the forbidden emission suggests that the Fe II\nlines are formed in the dense broad-line region (BLR), but photo-ionization models cannot\naccount for all of the Fe II emission. The \u2019Fe II discrepancy\u2019 remains unsolved, though\nmodels which consider non-radiative heating with an overabundance of iron are promising\n(Joly 1993, Collin & Joly 2000). Also Mathur (2000) proposed that the strong Fe II\nemission observed in NLS1s may be connected with their large accretion rates and that a\n\u2013 4 \u2013\ncollisional ionization origin of Fe II is possible.\nHere we report 3D spectroscopic observations of Mrk 493. The aims of the observations\nwere (i) to investigate the characteristics of the Fe II emitting region and possible\ntheir connection with other emitting regions (H\u03b1, H\u03b2, [OIII], ...) and (ii) to map the\ncircum-nuclear emitting gas in this type of AGN. In this paper we accepted a distance to\nMrk 493 of 125.2 Mpc (for H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121), where 1\u2032\u2032 on the sky corresponds to 610\npc at the galaxy distance.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this paper we report the 3D spectrophotometric observations of the Mrk 493. From\nour investigation we can give the following conclusions:\n(i) The continuum and [SII] line emitting regions in Mrk 493 seem to be very extensive\n([SII] up to 1 kpc, and continuum >1kpc), and they are larger than the [OIII], Fe II and\nBalmer emission line regions.\n(ii) It seems that the strong Fe II emission is not coming from the BLR (WBLR \u223c2000\nkm/s), but from a region with velocity dispersion around 800 km/s.\nThis is in an\nagreement with some earlier investigation given by Popovi\u00b4c et al. (2004) and recent ones\ngiven by Kuehn et al. (2008) and Hu et al. (2008) that a large fraction of the Fe II emission\nmay come from an ILR.\n(iii) There is no changes of the continuum and emission lines (instead He II\u03bb4686)\nbetween two observations (in the three-year period), that may also indicate non-BLR origin\nof lines. Otherwise, the BLR in Mrk 493 should be a): very extensive \u223c1pc and/or b) very\nstable.\n(iv) The source of ionization of the narrow Balmer and [OIII] line emitting regions in\nMrk 493 seems to not be the nucleus, but the star-forming processes;\n(v) The position of the line and continuum regions coincides with a composite nuclear\nregion: an AGN plus a circum-nuclear star-forming ring observed in the HST UV/optical\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nimages, but it seems that the emitting source of the narrow line and continuum is probably\nthe circum-nuclear star-forming ring, but here remains a question about the mechanism of\nthe Fe II production in a such ring.", "response": "We report the results of 3D spectroscopic observations of Mrk 493 (NLS1\ngalaxy) with the integral-field spectrograph MPFS of the SAO RAS 6-m telescope.\nThe difference in the slope of the optical continuum emission intensity across\nthe nucleus part and an extensive continuum emission region} is detected. The\nemission in lines (H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, [OIII], etc.) coincides with a\ncomposite nuclear region: an AGN plus a circum-nuclear star-forming ring\nobserved in the HST UV/optical images.

We find a strong correlation\nbetween the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the\nprogenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Jet breaks and Energetics of Swift GRB X-ray Afterglows':\n\nIntroduction:\nOne of the most surprising puzzles to emerge from the Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004) mission\nand its dynamic study of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) is the lack of expected jet breaks in\nX-ray afterglow emission. It is vital to the entire study of GRBs to understand jet geometry,\nbecause of the inferred e\ufb00ects on the total output energy, GRB rate, afterglow structure,\ninteractions with environment, and jet physical mechanisms. Pre-Swift optical observations\nshowed tens of cases of steepening in the light curves several days after the GRB triggers\n(Frail et al. 2001; Bloom, Frail, & Sari 2001; Zeh, Klose, & Kann 2006). This steepening\nwas interpreted as evidence for the collimation of the burst ejecta with physical half-angle \u03b8j.\nThe ejecta moves at relativistic velocities with a bulk Lorentz factor, \u0393, and the radiation is\nrelativistically beamed into an angle \u03b8 = 1/\u0393. As the ejecta sweeps up surrounding material,\nthe \ufb01reball decelerates, with the beaming angle eventually exceeding the physical collimation\nangle, causing a sudden increase in the rate of decay of the \ufb02ux (i.e. the jet break). At the\nsame time, sideways expansion of the ejecta with relativistic speeds also causes a sudden\n\ufb02ux decrease (Sari, Piran, & Halpern 1999; Rhoads 1999; Zhang & M\u00b4esz\u00b4aros 2004). Most\nlikely both of these e\ufb00ects contribute to the jet breaks, and therefore, both models must\nbe considered.\nBreaks are expected to be achromatic based on the assumption that the\nafterglow emission regions and mechanisms are the same for various spectral regimes, and\nshould therefore only re\ufb02ect ejecta geometry. Achromaticity has indeed been con\ufb01rmed in\nthe optical/near-infrared bands in pre-Swift GRBs (Kulkarni et al. 1999; Harrison et al.\n2001; Klose et al. 2004).\nIn the Swift era, it is X-ray afterglow light curves that provide the most homogeneous\ndata set to study GRB afterglows. With the rapid GRB triggers provided by the Swift -\nBAT, and the autonomous prompt Swift -XRT observations that frequently begin within 1-2\nminutes of the trigger, X-ray afterglows have gone from sparsely sampled single power-laws\n(Beppo-SAX era, de Pasquale et al. 2006) to a rich database of light curves with widely\nvarying properties and durations. A common canonical shape of the Swift -XRT X-ray light\ncurves emerged (Nousek et al. (2006); Zhang et al. (2006), Figure 1) with \ufb01ve components\n(an initial steep decay, a shallow-decay \u201cplateau\u201d phase, a normal decay, a jet-like decay\ncomponent, and \ufb02ares) that could be used to explain the overall structure of the afterglows.\nWhile elements of this canonical picture are seen in most X-ray afterglows, few afterglows\ncontain all 5 components. Surprisingly, fully \u201ccanonical\u201d jet breaks are rarely observed in\nthe XRT light curves (Burrows & Racusin 2007; Liang et al. 2008; Evans et al. 2008).\nIn this work, we assume that all X-ray afterglows have inherently similar shapes (the\ncanonical shape) with deviations in behavior due to environment, electron spectral shape,\nspectral regime, presence of energy injection, and jet properties. We also explore observa-\n\u2013 3 \u2013\ntional biases such as late beginning and early ending of observation, \ufb02ares, and observing\ngaps that lead to missing portions of individual light curves which can produce ambiguities\nin the identi\ufb01cation of segments.\nWe assume that the light curve segments following the initial steep decay (Figure 1,\nsegments II-IV) are due to external forward shocks.\n\nConclusion:\nThere are several di\ufb00erent observational categories of potential jet breaks that do not\nlook like the conventional jet breaks that strictly follow the canonical form on which previous\nstudies have focused. These categories include post-jet break segments with energy injec-\ntion in segment III where the normal isotropic models do not \ufb01t, apparent segment II-III\nlight curves in which the latter segment requires a post-jet break model suggesting they are\nactually segments III-IV, apparent segments II-III that have temporal decays suggestive of\na III-IV or even a II-IV transition, other segments III that require a post-jet break model\nand cannot be \ufb01t by any of the isotropic models, and single power-laws that are apparently\npost-jet break. Those classi\ufb01cations for which we are at least somewhat con\ufb01dent are in-\ncluded in the Prominent, Hidden, and Possible jet break categories. Those that have some\ncharacteristics suggestive of post-jet break decay, but have temporal decays are similar to\n\u2013 25 \u2013\npre-jet break decays are placed in the Unlikely jet break category.\nPerhaps the most unexpected of these categories is the post-jet-break-with-energy-\ninjection scenario which has been suggested as an alternative option to explain speci\ufb01c GRB\nafterglows (Panaitescu et al. 2006; Oates et al. 2007; Schady et al. 2007; de Pasquale et al.\n2008). The idea of energy injection continuing after the jet break has intriguing implications\nfor jet break studies. Energy injection would have the e\ufb00ect of making the temporal decay\nshallower than the underlying jet break until the energy injection ends, which would then\nmanifest as another break in the light curve. This implies that sometimes the break be-\ntween segments II and III is not caused by the cessation of energy injection in the isotropic\nmodel but rather by continuation of energy injection through the jet break with the break to\nsegment IV occurring only after energy injection ceases. We \ufb01nd 4 examples in the Promi-\nnent jet break category and 7 in the Hidden jet break category which require this scenario\nto explain our model \ufb01ts, in addition to many other segments III that are consistent with\npost-jet-break-with-energy-injection models. This is signi\ufb01cantly larger than the 7.4 \u00b1 1.0\nthat we would have expected from our Monte Carlo simulations. These speci\ufb01c bursts are\nindicated in Table 2-3 with the alternative jet opening angle and jet break time listed for all\nof those for which at least one post-jet-break-with-energy-injection model is consistent.\nMany single power-law light curves can be explained within the context of the canonical\nlight curve formalism by observing biases (e.g. late start times, early stop times). However,\nthere are several exceptions. Some simply have large errors in \u03b1 due to light curves with\nfew bins.\nA few well constrained outliers remain, the most notable being GRB 061007,\nwhose light curve extends from 80 s to nearly one million seconds after the trigger, with\na continuous, well constrained, steep, smooth temporal decay.\nIf we assume that these\nafterglows behave like the canonical light curve, these results imply that the steeper single\npower-laws are post-jet break decays where the preceding light curve segments were either\nmissed due to a late start or masked by \ufb02aring activity.\nIn order to gauge the likelihood of these exceptions being pre- or post-jet break, we\ncalculate the expected collimated energy outputs limits (E\u03b3) in the method described in \u00a74.5\nfor these bursts if the jet breaks were prior to the start of the observations or after the end\nof the observations (Figure 18). Those bursts for which the observations extend beyond the\ntime frame for which we would expect a jet break based on the behavior of the Prominent\njet break category require enormous collimated energy outputs (\u226b1051 ergs), suggesting\nthat the jet break was prior to the observation start. These early jet breaks are di\ufb03cult to\nexplain in terms of the canonical form. There are 10 of these single power-law afterglows\nthat persist through the entire expected jet break time window, 3 of which have very well\nsampled light curves (GRB 050716, GRB 061007, GRB 061126). The 2 other than GRB\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n061007 have relatively shallow decays (\u03b1 \u223c1), suggesting they are pre-jet break. Perley\net al. (2008) and Gomboc et al. (2008) demonstrate inconsistencies between the optical and\nX-ray properties of GRB 061126 suggesting an additional component in needed to explain\nthe X-rays which is outside of the standard model.\nThese bursts remain enigmatic and\nare di\ufb03cult to understood in the context of the majority of Swift burst. They may have\nexceptionally late jet breaks, or perhaps do not break at all, implying a large jet opening\nangle or perhaps isotropic out\ufb02ow.\nAnother variation on the unusual non-canonical light curve categories are those with\nsegments I-II where segment II has a slope of \u223c1 and is consistent with the normal spherical\ndecay closure relations as well as the normal decay with energy injection relations. There\nare 19 light curves in our sample that \ufb01t these criteria. This deviation from the canonical\nbehavior implies either that these GRBs did not experience the energy injection phase, or\nthat segment I was misidenti\ufb01ed due to \ufb02aring behavior. These objects may be similar to\nthe shallow single power-law light curves except that their steep decay was observed \ufb01rst. In\nfact, 5 of these light curves \ufb01t our completeness criteria like those exceptional single power-\nlaw cases, implying that they are unusually long lived for segments II or III. Perhaps the\nlack of energy injection or cause of this phase di\ufb00ers somehow from that of the canonical\nafterglows. It is interesting to note that these X-ray light curves (after segment I) would\nhave been considered normal in the pre-Swift era.\nWe have unearthed many additional jet break candidates in the data, but the funda-\nmental question remains: why do more afterglows not have obvious jet breaks? The most\nstraightforward and plausible explanation for the lack of conventional jet breaks in XRT\nlight curves is simply that the observations end before the jet breaks occur. The more fun-\ndamental question is what makes these afterglows for which we do not observe jet breaks\ndi\ufb00erent from those for which we do observe jet breaks?\nWe have some cases of jet breaks at very late times (> 106 s). At these times, the\n\ufb02uxes are low, and uncertainties on the data points are large, making it di\ufb03cult to detect\njet breaks. In fact, many light curves end before this time frame, in which case we could\nbe missing the jet breaks completely. Curran et al. (2008) simulated GRB afterglow light\ncurves based on real XRT data and showed that hidden jet breaks could be present in even\nwell sampled XRT light curves. We evaluate the probability that such a bias exists within\nour data set by doing a similar exercise, calculating the last time at which a jet break could\noccur without being detectable. This time is determined by forcing an additional break into\nthe light curve with a slope equal to \u03b1f + 1, where \u03b1f is the measured slope of the last light\ncurve segment. We then \ufb01nd the earliest break time that increases the overall \u03c72 by 2.7\n(corresponding to 90% con\ufb01dence for one parameter of interest). We refer to this time as the\n\u2013 27 \u2013\njet break lower limit (tjblim). We excluded light curves with segment IV from this analysis,\nand \ufb01nd that an additional 8% of the light curves could not be \ufb01t in this way; in these cases\nthe jet break limit is the time of the last detection.\nThe distributions of times of last detections, jet break lower limits, and times of potential\njet breaks in both the observed frame and rest-frame are shown in Figure 19. The distribu-\ntions of jet break times for the Prominent, Hidden, and Possible jet break categories overlap,\nwith the latter sample peaking at an earlier time. This might be due to contamination in the\nPossible jet break sample by breaks that are not jet breaks. These other breaks may be from\nthe segment II-III transition, or the previously mentioned jet-breaks-with-energy-injection\n(between segments II and III) which tend to occur earlier than other (segment III-IV) jet\nbreaks. The important thing to extract from Figure 19 is that the majority of the bursts in\nthe Unlikely jet break and non-jet break categories have last detection and jet break lower\nlimits consistent with the range of Prominent jet break times. It is probable that these light\ncurves had jet breaks after XRT observations ended or that were buried within the noise of\nthe late time data. There are a few exceptions to this, particularly in those single power-law\nlight curves mentioned above that would have had to have their jet breaks very early (few\n\u00d7100 s) and did not break even beyond the expected jet break times. Perhaps these few\nbursts are fundamentally di\ufb00erent from those with jet breaks.\nWe also included short hard GRBs (SHBs) in our study of jet breaks, treating them\nthe same as the long bursts except in the calculation of E\u03b3,iso. Only the brightest X-ray\nafterglows of SHBs were included in our study, which may bias the understanding of this\ngroup in terms of the faint and quickly fading subsample that did not meet our minimum\nrequirements. The SHBs were placed into similar jet break subsamples as the long GRBs\n(i.e. 2 Prominent, 4 Possible, 3 Unlikely, and 4 non-jet breaks). The SHBs have on average\nsmaller values of E\u03b3,iso and E\u03b3 than the long bursts. Those SHBs that show jet breaks\nand similarity to the canonical model perhaps have some fundamental di\ufb00erences in their\nenvironments or physical mechanisms from those that simply fade quickly (Troja et al. 2008;\nSakamoto & Gehrels 2009).\nComparing this work to other recent studies of jet breaks in X-ray afterglows (Burrows\n& Racusin 2007; Willingale et al. 2007; Panaitescu 2007; Kocevski & Butler 2008; Liang\net al. 2008; Evans et al. 2008), we \ufb01nd signi\ufb01cant overlap with our jet break candidates.\nMost di\ufb00erences can be attributed to di\ufb00ering interpretation of light curve \ufb01tting and \ufb02aring\nand generally more limited jet break de\ufb01nitions in those other studies. Each study used\nindependent jet break criteria and there were several di\ufb00erent independent data analysis\npipelines. Our work builds upon these other studies with our systematic analysis of the\ninteraction between all of the light curve regions for each burst, broad closure relation model\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nusage, careful searches for jet breaks buried in the data, and characterization of the energetics\nand limits.\n6.\nConclusions\nPre-Swift expectations for GRB X-ray afterglows have been substantially revised with\nthe great wealth of XRT observations. While we try to categorize and classify their proper-\nties, there is still a wide range of unexplained diversity in GRB afterglow properties. Within\nthe limits of theoretical expectations and observational biases, we have attempted to survey\nthe properties of the X-ray afterglows.\nIn agreement with some previous studies (Burrows & Racusin 2007, Liang et al. 2008,\nWillingale et al. 2007, Kocevski & Butler 2008, Evans et al. 2008), we \ufb01nd only a small\nfraction (\u223c12%) of our total sample has a late-time break that is clearly a jet break justi\ufb01ed\nby the closure relations. We \ufb01nd an additional \u223c30% with observational biases that make\nsegments IV non-distinct but with a strong case for post-jet break temporal and spectral\nproperties. Some of the bursts in our sample remain ambiguous in the jet break designation.\nDespite not being able to make absolute claims about these speci\ufb01c bursts, we demonstrate\nthat there are jet breaks hidden within the data and observational biases. This suggests that\nthere are \u223c20% more jet breaks in the XRT afterglows than previous studies have revealed\nand at least 40% of the missing jet breaks can be attributed to observational biases. Some\nof our light curves that require energy injection to continue post-jet break may have been\npreviously misidenti\ufb01ed as the end of the energy injection phase.\nEvans et al. (2008) also explores the canonical X-ray afterglow form using the XRT\nsample, where they \ufb01nd that less than half of all light curves behave canonically, and one\nquarter are \u201coddballs\u201d. Many of these \u201coddballs\u201d can be explained by the scenarios we use\nto describe the ambiguous cases discussed in this paper. While their approach is somewhat\ndi\ufb00erent, their conclusions are similar to ours.\nOur study requires post-jet break energy injection to explain 4 cases of the Prominent\njet break sample and 11 others in the Hidden jet break category.\nThis modi\ufb01cation to\nthe canonical X-ray afterglow form alters expectations from simply studying the light curve\nalone, and adds to the theory needed to explain the diversity of observed properties.\nThese explanations do not solve all of the remaining problems related to jet breaks.\nSeveral afterglow light curves, particularly the ones who can only be \ufb01t by a single power-\nlaw, persist with a constant slope prior to and beyond the times for which we would expect a\njet break. These bursts require either an exceptionally early jet break (sometimes before 100\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nsec) or an exceptionally late jet break, requiring a large jet opening angle and an enormous\n(\u226b1051 erg) collimation corrected energy output.\nSwift GRBs are on average at higher redshifts, smaller jet opening angles, lower isotropic\nequivalent energies, and lower collimated \u03b3-ray energies compared to GRBs observed prior\nto Swift. Some of these e\ufb00ects can be attributed to the lower energy coverage and supe-\nrior sensitivity of the Swift -BAT. However, the consequences of these observational biases\ntowards selecting di\ufb00erent sorts of bursts is unexpected.\nOne of the fundamental predictions of the jet break models used in this work is achro-\nmatic behavior in a single spectral component. The jet break should be a purely geometrical\ne\ufb00ect and should therefore not be limited to the X-ray afterglows. Other components of the\nafterglow geometry may be more closely tied to emission segments and mechanisms making\ndirect afterglow comparison di\ufb03cult. Modeling of the complete spectral energy distribution\nwould be necessary to understand how the spectral breaks might in\ufb02uence the chromatic light\ncurve behavior. This would be further complicated by uncertainties in the optical extinction\nand X-ray absorption. These detailed spectral studies, which are beyond the scope of this\nwork, would provide additional information if simultaneous optical, infrared, and radio ob-\nservations were available to narrow down the closure relations models and better constrain\nthe physical models. Liang et al. (2008) have already made some progress on exploring\nmulti-wavelength approach to this problem, speci\ufb01cally evaluating cases of chromatic versus\nachromatic breaks.\nJ.L.R., D.N.B., and A.F. gratefully acknowledge support for this work from NASA con-\ntract NAS5-00136.

The frequencies of\nthese QPOs range from \u223c10\u22122 Hz to \u223c103 Hz.

This paper focuses on these kHz PDS\nfeatures, referred to as twin kHz QPOs.\nFrom here on, we adopt the convention of calling the two\npeaks forming twin kHz QPOs the lower and upper QPO and\ndenote their frequencies as \u03bdL < \u03bdU. The twin kHz QPOs span a\nwide frequency range and follow a nearly linear \u03bdU\u2013\u03bdL relation\nfor each source (Belloni et al. 2005; Abramowicz et al. 2005b;\n\nConclusion:", "response": "AIMS: For six neutron-star atoll sources (4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53, 4U 0614+09,\n4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1735-44) we investigate the relationship between\nthe observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether\nthis displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the\nproposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude\nbetween the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.\nWe compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set\nII has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous\nsegments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we\nfind that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the\ntwo twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow\ninterval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources\nto explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.\nThere is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four\nsources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented\nclustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources\nstudied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the\nfrequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is\nroughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models,\nwith some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the\nexistence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at\nwhich the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a\nmore general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible\nexistence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes."}

This decay softens the scaling\nof temperature T with cosmological scale factor a, increasing the Hubble parameter\nH(T) and leading to earlier freeze-out for certain relics.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Rapid pulsations in sub-THz solar bursts':\n\nIntroduction:\nSolar flare impulsive emissions in the radio range are usually explained by two \ndistinct processes: radiation at longer metric-decimetric wavelengths exhibit flux densities \ndecreasing with frequency (usually narrowband), attributed to excited plasma emissions \nhigher in the solar corona (Wild & Smerd 1972). Broadband microwaves are attributed to \ngyro-synchrotron losses in the magnetic field while accelerated electrons move into denser \nregions to produce hard X- and gamma rays by collision losses (Dulk, Melrose & White \n1979; Kundu & Vlahos 1982; Bastian, Benz & Gary 1998). The two mechanisms compose \nthe well known U-shaped radio burst spectra (Castelli 1972; Nita, Gary & Lee 2004). The \nTHz flux vs. frequency increasing spectral component, recently discovered by Kaufmann et \nal. (2004),  suggests a \u201cW-shaped\u201d spectrum as illustrated in Figure 1, possibly \nrepresentative of a third emission mechanism.  \n2\n \nTime profiles at various radio wavelengths and X-ray ranges are not always well \ncorrelated. Examples of time profiles with delays of several seconds at short microwaves \nand hard X-rays (> 30 keV) were found (Takakura et al. 1983; Lim et al. 1992; Kaufmann \net al. 1983; Costa & Kaufmann 1983; Silva, Wang & Gary 2000).  The burst impulsive \nphase onset may occur first at lower frequencies, although there are also examples with \ndelays in the opposite sense. Fast superimposed time structures at much shorter second to \nsub-second scales, obtained by observations with higher sensitivity and time resolution, \nhave indicated that they are synchronized by less than 200 ms at short microwaves and at \nhard X-rays (Cornell et al. 1984; Takakura et al. 1983; Kaufmann et al. 2000). \n \nBroadband solar burst rapid pulsations at cm-mm wavelengths were well \ncharacterized (Butz et al. 1976; Gaizauskas & Tapping 1980; Kaufmann et al. 1980; 1985; \nAllaart et al. 1990, Benz et al. 1992; Qin et al. 1996; Huang, Qin & Yao 1996; Raulin et al.\n1998; Nakajima 2000; Altyntsev et al. 2000). A puzzling qualitative proportionality \nbetween pulse repetition rates and underlying mean fluxes has been found at 10, 22, 30, 44, \n48 and 90 GHz (Kaufmann et al. 1980; 1985; Correia & Kaufmann 1987; Raulin et al. \n1998) and at 9.4 and 15 GHz (Qin et al. 1996; Huang, Qin & Yao 1996). It might be \ninterpreted as the response to discrete injections quasi-quantized in energy (Kaufmann et al.\n1980); by wave-particle plasma instabilities saturation time inversely proportional to \nradiation time (Huang, Qin & Yao 1996) or by modulation of flare kernel emission by \nmagnetic field oscillations driven by Alfv\u00e9n waves which period decreases for larger \ntemperatures (Qin et al. 1996) \n \nThe present study addresses the distinctive aspects of rapid pulsations observed at \nsub-THz solar bursts. They are analyzed for their repetition rates vs. time profiles at sub-\nTHz frequencies, at hard X-rays and \u03b3-rays and on the differences when compared to \npulsations in the microwave range of frequencies.\n\nConclusion:\nThe pulses superimposed onto the broadband solar bursts emission might be \ninterpreted as a response to physical processes at the origin of the flare. Different \nmechanisms may be assigned for emissions producing the distinct spectral structures \n(Figure 1). Maximum microwave fluxes are at frequencies in the range 5-20 GHz (Guidice \n5\n& Castelli 1975), and some times extending up to 100 GHz (Croom 1971, Nakajima et al.\n1985; Bastian, Fleishman & Gary 2007). The spectral component B in Figure 1 is usually \nattributed to electron gyrosynchrotron radiation (Dulk 1985; Bastian, Benz & Gary 1998). \nAt meter-decimeter wavelengths the burst emission intensity increases for smaller \nfrequencies (spectral structure A in Figure 1). This component is usually attributed to \nplasma emission excited by fast electrons or by shock waves (Wild & Smerd 1972). The \nnature of the THz burst emission (structure C in Figure 1) is not well understood. It might \nbe attributed to a distinct synchrotron emission by ultrarelativistic electrons (Kaufmann et \nal. 2004; 2009; Kaufmann & Raulin 2006). Often the burst emission at the U-shaped \nminima (roughly 0.5-5 GHz, see Figure 1) may contain contributions of different origin \nadded together (Alaart et al. 1990; Altyntsev et al. 2003). Mixed contributions from \ndifferent mechanisms may also occur at the 30-200 GHz spectral minimum. \nQuasi periodic pulsations of gyrosynchrotron emission at microwaves are known to \ncover a wide range of time scales - from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds - and \nare interpreted in terms of modulation of source parameters undergoing MHD oscillations \nand/or modulation of electron acceleration or injection (Fleishman, Bastian & Gary 2008).  \nThe proportionality between flux and pulse rate at millimeter waves (Kaufmann et al. 1980; \nRaulin et al. 1998) supports the hypothesis that impulsive bursts might be a response to \nrapid injections quasi-quantized in energy (Kaufmann et al. 1980, Sturrock et al. 1984).  \nThe ripple structure superimposed onto impulsive bursts time profiles might be the result of \nthe convolution of pulses of a given lifetime with a variable repetition rate (Loran et al.\n1985).  \nThe flux vs pulse rate correlation was also suggested to be a response to the inverse \ncorrelation between the saturation time of a wave-particle plasma instability originating the \nburst and the radiation time (Huang, Qin & Yao 1996). This effect might also be attributed \nto the modulation of flare kernel emission by magnetic field oscillations driven by Alfv\u00e9n \nwaves, whose period decreases for larger temperatures (Qin et al. 1996). This interpretation \nassumes that the GHz emission is produced by gyro-synchrotron radiation from electrons \nmoving in the active region magnetic field. However, Fleishman, Bastian & Gary (2008) \ninterpretation of a pulsating microwave burst, based on Dulk (1985) gyro-synchrotron \nemission formulas, has shown that for sausage mode MHD oscillations the flux variations \nin the optically thick part of the spectrum (i.e., frequencies smaller than the spectral peak in \nFigure 1 structure B) should be anti-correlated in time with variations observed in the \noptically thin part of the spectrum (i.e. for frequencies higher that the spectral peak). This \neffect was not observed, leading them to suggest that the pulsations were associated to \nquasi-periodic injection of emitting electrons. \nIt has been found qualitatively that the relative pulse amplitude \u2206S/S increase for \nhigher frequencies, as shown in Figure 11 (Kaufmann et al. 1985; Correia & Kaufmann \n1987). This trend agree with the large relative pulse amplitudes observed at 44 GHz (about \n80%) at the onset and decay of the November 4, 2003 event (see Figures 9 and 10) nearly \nten times larger than the sub-THz pulses relative amplitudes. However the observed sub-\nTHz \u2206S/S for the three events analyzed here are considerably smaller than expected when \nextrapolated from GHz observations (Kaufmann et al. 1985; Correia & Kaufmann 1987) \n(Figure 11).  \nThe sub-THz component might be described as the optically thick part of the \nsynchrotron radiation emitted by highly energetic electrons (> 10 MeV) moving in a strong \n6\nmagnetic field (\u2265 1000 Gauss) (Kaufmann et al. 2004; 2009; Kaufmann & Raulin 2006; \nSilva et al. 2007; Trottet et al. 2008, Cristiani et al, 2008). It should be somehow causally \nrelated but physically distinct from the GHz component. The linear relationship between \nsub-THz fluxes and pulse repetition rates might be a direct indication that the flare \naccelerator injects discrete quantized energy packets. The emissions at microwaves as well \nas at other ranges of energy might present proportional relations to these repetitive \nenergetic injections that need more investigation. \n5. Concluding remarks\nIt has been shown that rapid pulsations are found superimposed onto all events that \npresent the THz spectral component. Pulse rates estimates were performed using wavelet \ndecomposition at two sub-THz frequencies, 212 and 405 GHz. The pulse count criteria \nwere set by fluctuation thresholds determined before the events. Pulses were particularly \nwell defined for one event (November 4, 2003). For the other two events, the pulse \nidentification was limited by the poor quality of atmosphere transmission, affecting mainly \nthe 405 GHz data.  \n     Similar small \u2206S/S were found for two other solar flares observed at sub-THz \nfrequencies, on April 6, 2001 (Kaufmann et al. 2002), and on August 25, 2001 (Raulin et \nal. 2003). They were not included in this study because there were indications that the sub-\nTHz emissions might contain contributions from both GHz and THz spectral components \n(B and C in Figure 1). \nNevertheless the analysis revealed two relevant properties of the sub-THz pulses: \n(a) the mean  fluxes (S) are proportional to the  pulse repetition rates (R) according to the \nsimple relationship S \u2248 k R; (b) the pulse amplitudes relative to the mean flux, \u2206S/S are \nsmall, ranging 5-10% throughout the bursts durations. It follows that the flux vs pulse rate \nrelationship might be interpreted as response to discrete and successive energetic injections, \nquantized in energy: 4 10-19 J m-2 Hz-1 at 405 GHz, and 0.8-1.2 10-19 J m-2 Hz-1 at 212 GHz. \nThe result (a) confirms the flux vs pulse rate qualitative relationship known in GHz \nbursts (Kaufmann et al. 1980; Qin et al. 1996; Huang, Qin & Yao 1996; Raulin et al.\n1998), and shows a good fit to a linear correlation. The correlation coefficients worsen \nwhen atmospheric transmission is poor, especially at 405 GHz. The sub-THz flux increase \nwith frequency might be associated to the optically thick part of synchrotron emission by \nhigh energy electrons (> 10 MeV).  \nIn the GHz range, however, the relative pulse amplitude (\u2206S/S) increases \nsubstantially with frequency (Correia & Kaufmann 1987, Huang, Qin & Yao 1996, see \nFigure 11), an effect that was confirmed by observations at 44 GHz for the onset and late \ndecay of the November 4, 2003 burst (Figures 9 and 10). For the sub-THz events, however, \nthe observed \u2206S/S  are comparable at the two frequencies (212 and 405 GHz) and \nconsiderably smaller than expected from extrapolated values. This apparent qualitative \ncontradiction might be an indication that two distinct emission mechanisms produce the \nspectrally separated GHz and THz components.  \n \nThe production of the two GHz and THz spectral components (components B and C \nin Figure 1) might be explained by conceiving independent accelerators at the flaring \nsource, producing different energy electrons nearly simultaneously, emitting the two \nspectral components. The spectral components B and C in Figure 1 would be representative \n7\nof two synchrotron emission spectra, by electrons with mildly relativistic energies and \nultrarelativistic energies, respectively. However the observations available are still too \nlimited to support this possibility. Another scenario suggested by Wild & Smerd (1972) \nmight be adopted, placing a single accelerator closer to a single polarity foot-point injecting \nelectrons into a magnetic morphology split into two separate loops, one low altitude with \nstronger field, another weaker field, higher above the solar surface, originating the two \nsynchrotron spectral components, on peaking in the GHz and another in the THz range.  \nAlthough this possibility was suggested in the discussion of the November 2, 2003 event \n(Silva et al. 2007), it requires very strong magnetic fields, of the order of the largest ones \nobserved to date. In both scenarios the relative pulse amplitude (\u2206S/S) features in the GHz \nand sub-THz ranges remain to be explained.  An alternate interpretation take into account \nthe contribution to spectral emissions from electron beam instabilities observed in \nlaboratory accelerators (Nodvick & Saxon 1954, Williams 2002; Carr et al. 2002; Byrd et \nal. 2002) proposed to happen in solar flares (Kaufmann & Raulin 2006; Klopf 2008). \nObservations are needed at higher frequencies in the THz range, as well as with \nhigher time resolution and sensitivity in the GHz range. High sensitivity and time \nresolution solar patrol polarimeters at 45 and 90 GHz are planned for El Leoncito \nObservatory with the support of the Brazilian research agency FAPESP and Argentinean \nagency CONICET. Solar photometry at two THz frequencies are considered by the \nexperiment DESIR (Detection of Solar eruptive Infrared Radiation) on the French-China \nsatellite SMESE (SMall Explorer for the study of Solar Eruptions) (Vial et al. 2008). These \nnew experiments are expected to bring new clues to understand the origin, the nature, and \nthe relationship between flare emission at GHz, THz, and other ranges of energy, in \nresponse to repetitive discrete energetic injections, and their possible association with \nanalogous physical processes in laboratory accelerators. \nAcknowledgements.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Search for the magnetic field of the O7.5 III star xi Persei':\n\nIntroduction:\nLike many O and B stars, the O7.5III(n)((f)) star \u03be Per shows very prominent cyclical\nwind variability in the UV resonance lines (Fig. 1a), manifested by discrete absorption\ncomponents (DACs) which migrate from red to blue, and narrow when they approach\n(but not reach) the terminal velocity as measured from saturated wind pro\ufb01les (e.g.\nKaper et al. 1999). In \u03be Per the DAC period is 2.09 d. Multiwavelength observations of\na number of OB stars, including \u03be Per, have shown that the cyclic behavior is present\ndown to the surface of the star (de Jong et al. 1997), and that the typical timescale varies\nwith the (estimated) rotational timescale. This strongly argues in favor of a surface\nphenomenon which perturbs the base of the \ufb02ow. Two scenarios are proposed: in the\nso-called Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) model a perturbation at the surface of\nthe star causes a local increase (or decrease) of the radiative force driving the stellar\nwind, or surface magnetic \ufb01elds may disturb the out\ufb02ow, both resulting in a rotationally\nmodulated stellar wind (see Cranmer and Owocki 1996).

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'A New Model For Vela Jr. Supernova Remnant':\n\nIntroduction:\nIt is widely discussed that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are among the\nmost promising galactic candidates for the Cosmic Rays (CRs) accelerators\nup to the energy of 1014 \u2013 1015 eV (see [1, 2] and references therein). The\ndirect evidence for the acceleration of leptonic component of CRs in SNRs\nis synchrotron emission in a broad domain of the electromagnetic spectrum\nranging from radio to X-rays. In the same time we are missing the direct\nevidence for the hadronic acceleration in SNRs. This is important point be-\ncause the composition of CRs is mainly hadronic according to the observed\n\u2217email: igor space@ukr.net, Tel: +380979202336\n\nConclusion:\nThe breakthrough of modern observational techniques provided the com-\nmunity with unprecedented results. The detection of \u03b3-rays from long de-\nbated SNRs gives unique opportunity to \ufb01nd the clue to the solution of the\nhigh energy CRs problem. Nonetheless, the broadband data on the \u03b3-ray\nSNRs appeared to be somewhat ambiguous in the sense of explanation of the\nobserved \u03b3-ray emission by the mechanism of the hadron origin.\nIn this paper we aimed to give the explanation of the Vela Jr. broadband\nemission (radio, X-rays and \u03b3-rays) applying the hydrodynamical model of\nthe transition from adiabatic to radiative stage of the SNR evolution. Con-\nditions that are formed during this stage satisfy the origin of hadronic \u03b3-ray\n\ufb02ux and thus can prove the existence of acceleration of CRs in SNRs. To this\nend we are comfortable with our result because it does not contradict to the\nexperimental data and is self-consistent. A new age of 17 500 yr proposed\nhere is the direct consequence of the hydrodynamical calculations for the\nnormal ISM number density and assumed energy of explosion. The obtained\nradius of 10.2 pc and corresponding distance of 600 pc are well in range of\nthe proposed earlier values (200 \u2013 1 000 pc). Therefore, we \ufb01nd our result\n15\nfor the age of Vela Jr. normal. The only thing that would contradict to\nthis age is the Ti44 line detection [37] which signi\ufb01cance was questioned in\n[38]. Besides, there are strong implications that Vela Jr. is indeed rather old\nremnant. Among these implications is the measurement of the X-ray expan-\nsion of the north-western rim of Vela Jr. [39]. The expansion measurement\nshowed that it is about \ufb01ve times lower than in the historical SNRs and is\ncomparable to that of the Cygnus Loop which is known to be in the post\nSedov stage of evolution [39]. Another implication that Vela Jr. is not a\nyoung remnant is a possible association of the pulsar PSR J0855-4644 with\nVela Jr. [40]. In case this pulsar is really associated with Vela Jr. the age\nof the remnant must exceed 3 000 yr or even more. Yet another object SAX\nJ0852.0-4615 could be associated with Vela Jr. Being located at the geomet-\nrical centre of Vela Jr. it is a neutron star candidate with a probable age of\na few 104 yr [41].\nWe would like to note that the fraction of SN energy transferred to CRs\nin our model of Vela Jr. is very near the conservative value of 5% needed to\nexplain the replenishment of CRs in our Galaxy. We do not need to assume\nsome extreme fraction (several 10%) of energy transfer to CRs in order to\nexplain the observed \u03b3-ray \ufb02ux in particular case. It should be noted that\nby absolute value of energy transfer to galactic CRs, SNRs like Vela Jr. (i.e.\nlow energetic SNe) could not power galactic CRs on their own, however the\nlack of energy can be well compensated by the absolute input from more\nenergetic than standard 1051 erg SN explosions.\nWe would also like to note that the spectrum in the energy range 0.1-2\nkeV is contaminated by the emission of Vela SNR. At the same time the\nemission from Vela Jr. is strongly absorbed in this range. Therefore, it is\nhard to explain the emission of this range that is presented with the light\ngrey area at our Figs. 1 \u2013 3.\n7. Conclusions\nWe applied our hydrodynamical model of the transition stage to Vela Jr.\nSupernova Remnant. We showed that even in moderate ISM density we still\ncan account for the considerable \u03b3-ray \ufb02ux from the SNR. Contrary to the\nwidespread opinion that Vela Jr. is a young SNR, our model age is 17 500 yr\nand the remnant is at the beginning of the transition to radiative stage. The\nISM number density at the place of explosion was 1.5 cm\u22123 that is normal\nvalue for the Galactic plane. Explosion energy was 0.2 \u00d7 1051 ergs. The\n16\ndistance to Vela Jr. according to our model is 600 pc. The derived from\nthe model broadband spectrum of Vela Jr. as well as corresponding \ufb02uxes\nare in good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the modelled \u03b3-\nray surface brightness map exhibits features that spatially coincide with the\nH.E.S.S. \u03b3-ray map in [10]. The obtained value of the proton cut-o\ufb00energy\nmakes Vela Jr. a probable PeV accelerator.\nAcknowledgements\nIT is grateful to Dr. Bohdan Hnatyk for fruitful discussions on the topic\nof the paper and to VIRGO.UA for using its computing resources.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Null geodesics and observational cosmology':\n\nIntroduction:\nThe averaging problem in cosmology is perhaps the most important unsolved problem in\nmathematical cosmology. The averaging of local inhomogeneities in general relativity (GR)\ncan lead to very signi\ufb01cant dynamical e\ufb00ects on the evolution of the Universe. We discuss\nthe e\ufb00ects that averaging (and inhomogeneities in general) can have on the interpretation\nof cosmological data. All deductions about cosmology are based on the paths of photons.\nIn particular, we discuss some theoretical aspects of the motion of photons in an averaged\ngeometry.\nCosmological observations [1, 2], based on the assumption of a spatially homogeneous and\nisotropic Friedmann-Lema\u02c6\u0131tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model plus small perturbations,\nare usually interpreted as implying that there exists dark energy, the spatial geometry is\n\ufb02at, and that there is currently an accelerated expansion giving rise to the so-called \u039bCDM-\nconcordance model with \u2126m \u223c1/3 and \u2126de \u223c2/3. Although the concordance model is quite\nremarkable, it does not convincingly \ufb01t all data [2, 3, 4, 5]. Unfortunately, if the underlying\ncosmological model is not a perturbation of an exact \ufb02at FLRW solution, the conventional\ndata analysis and their interpretation is not necessarily valid. There is the related question\nof whether the Universe is \u2018exactly FLRW\u2019 on some large scale (the scale of homogeneity is\npresumably \u223c400 h\u22121Mpc or greater, since there is strong evidence for coherent bulk \ufb02ows\non scales out to at least 300h\u22121Mpc [5]), or only approximately FLRW at all scales (in which\ncase there is also the \u2018\ufb01tting problem\u2019 of which background FLRW model to take [6]).\nInhomogeneities can a\ufb00ect observational calculations [7]. Supernovae data (in combina-\ntion with other observational data), dynamically requires an accelerating universe. However,\nthis only implies the existence of dark matter if the Universe is (approximately) FLRW.\nSupernovae data can be explained without dark matter in inhomogeneous models, where\nthe full e\ufb00ects of GR come into play. The apparent acceleration of the Universe is thus not\ncaused by repulsive gravity due to dark energy, but rather is a dynamical result of inhomo-\n2\ngeneities, either in an exact solution or via averaging e\ufb00ects. In an exact inhomogeneous\ncosmological model, the inhomogeneities a\ufb00ect the dynamics of the model, and a special\nobserver can indeed measure the observed e\ufb00ects, although the results are, of course, model\ndependent.\nIn particular, averaging e\ufb00ects are real, but their relative importance must be determined.\nIn the FLRW plus perturbations approach, the (backreaction) e\ufb00ects are assumed small (and\nare assumed to stay small during the evolution of the universe). A perturbation scheme is\nchosen, and assumptions are made so that the approximation scheme is well de\ufb01ned (i.e.,\nassumptions are made so that there are no divergences and the backreaction stays small at the\nlevel of the perturbation, and the estimated corrections are small by de\ufb01nition [9]). This is\nperhaps a cyclical argument, but is has merit since it suggests that there is a self-consistent\nargument that backreactions are and remain small within the FLRW plus perturbations\napproach. Presumably, divergences would signal a breakdown in the approximation scheme\nwhen backreaction e\ufb00ects could be large.\nThere is also the possibility that averaging e\ufb00ects are not small (i.e., perturbation theory\ncannot be used to estimate the e\ufb00ects, and real inhomogeneous e\ufb00ects must be included).\nThis is much more di\ufb03cult to study, but the results from exact inhomogeneous solutions\nperhaps suggest that this ought to be investigated properly. There is also the question of\nwhat it means for an e\ufb00ect not to be small (and hence not negligible). It has been argued\nthat an a\ufb00ect at the 1% level can be regarded as signi\ufb01cant, and could very well a\ufb00ect the\ndynamics and interpretation of observational data [10].\nAveraging: The averaging problem in cosmology is of considerable importance for the\ncorrect interpretation of cosmological data. The correct governing equations on cosmological\nscales are obtained by averaging the Einstein equations. By assuming spatial homogeneity\nand isotropy on the largest scales, the inhomogeneities a\ufb00ect the dynamics though correction\n(backreaction) terms, which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively di\ufb00erent\n3\nfrom the FLRW models.\nThe macroscopic gravity (MG) approach is an exact approach which gives a prescription\nfor the correlation functions that emerge in an averaging of the Einstein \ufb01eld equations [11].\nIn [12] the MG equations were explicitly solved in a FLRW background geometry and it\nwas found that the correlation tensor (backreaction) is of the form of a spatial curvature.\nThis result was con\ufb01rmed in subsequent work in which the spherically symmetric Einstein\nequations were explicitly averaged [13], and is consistent with the scalar averaging approach\nof Buchert [14] in the Newtonian limit and with the results of averaging an exact Lema\u02c6\u0131tre-\nTolman-Bondi (LTB) model and the results of linear perturbation theory [15]. There is no\nquestion that the backreaction e\ufb00ect is real. The only question remaining is the size of the\ne\ufb00ect. However, even a small non-zero curvature |\u2126k| \u223c.01 would lead to signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ects\non observations (for redshifts z \u22650.9) [16]; indeed, values of |\u2126k| \u223c0.05 or larger have been\nfound to be consistent with observation [17].\nCurvature estimates: The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) has reported\n\u2126tot = 1.02 \u00b1 0.02 [2]. In \u039bCDM models type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data alone prefers a\nslightly closed Universe [1]. Taken at face value this suggests \u2126k = 0.02. Models with non-\nnegligible curvature have been studied recently [17]. Indeed, models with no dark energy have\nbeen found to be consistent with supernovae data and WMAP data [4]. Combining these\nobservations with Large Scale Structure (LSS) observations such as the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAO) data put stringent limits on the curvature parameter in the context of\nadiabatic \u039bCDM models. However, these data analyses are very model- and prior-dependent\n[18], and care is needed in the proper interpretation of data.\nLet us discuss the observational estimates in more detail. To \ufb01rst order, the averaged\ncurvature \u2126k evolves like a constant\u2013curvature model [19, 24, 10]. In the course of expansion\nthe second order kinematic backreaction \u2126Q becomes dynamically more important and can\nbecome signi\ufb01cant when the structure formation process injects backreaction [21]. For typical\n4\nscales \u2113\u223c50 - 200 h\u22121 Mpc and for a Hubble radius \u2113H \u223c3000 h\u22121 Mpc, values of second\norder e\ufb00ects \u223c(\u2113/\u2113H)2 are typically in the range 0.01 to 0.1. Robust estimators for intrinsic\ncurvature \ufb02uctuations using realistically modelled clusters and voids in a Swiss-cheese model\nindicates that the dark energy e\ufb00ects can be reduced by up to 30 % [20, 22].\n\nConclusion:", "response": "The Universe is not isotropic or spatially homogeneous on local scales. The\naveraging of local inhomogeneities in general relativity can lead to\nsignificant dynamical effects on the evolution of the Universe, and even if the\neffects are at the 1% level they must be taken into account in a proper\ninterpretation of cosmological observations. We discuss the effects that\naveraging (and inhomogeneities in general) can have on the dynamical evolution\nof the Universe and the interpretation of cosmological data.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Near-infrared bulge-disc correlations of lenticular galaxies':\n\nIntroduction:\nLenticular (S0) galaxies were originally conceived as a morpho-\nlogical transition class between ellipticals and early-type spirals by\nHubble (1936). These galaxies have disks spanning a wide range\nin luminosity, contributing between \ufb01ve to \ufb01fty percent of the to-\ntal galaxy light. They are distinguished from spiral galaxies by the\nlack of conspicuous spiral arms. For these reasons, lenticulars can\nbe thought of as a population which is intermediate between ellip-\nticals and early type spirals. Indeed, the placement of lenticulars by\nHubble (1936) on the tuning fork diagram clearly implies such a\nrelationship. In several observable properties such as bulge-to-disk\nluminosity ratio, star formation rate and colour, lenticulars are, on\naverage, intermediate between ellipticals and early type spirals.\nDetailed study of individual lenticular galaxies indicates that\nthe situation is more complex in reality. It has been suggested (van\nden Bergh 1994) that there are different, but overlapping, sub-\npopulations amongst the lenticulars. Exploration of formation sce-\n\u22c6E-mail: barway@saao.ac.za\nnarios for lenticulars using theory and numerical simulations also\nsuggest that lenticulars may have formed in different ways. They\ncould be of primordial origin forming rather rapidly at early epochs,\nor could have been formed by the slow stripping of gas from spirals,\nwhich changes the morphology (Abadi, Moore & Bower 1999), or\nthrough the mergers of unequal-mass spirals (Bekki 1998). The two\nmain components of lenticulars \u2013 the bulge and the disk \u2013 may have\ntheir own different and possibly independent formation history. Ob-\nservationally, the disks seem to be younger than the bulges in both\nspiral and lenticular galaxies (Peletier & Balcells 1996), with the\nage difference between the two components larger in lenticulars\n(Bothun & Gregg 1990). Bars in lenticular galaxies are also of in-\nterest in many studies as they provide a clue about the evolutionary\nhistory of these galaxies. Recent studies reveal that bars in lenticu-\nlar galaxies are shorter, less massive and have smaller bar torques\n(Buta et al. 2006; Laurikainen et al. 2005; Laurikainen et al. 2006;\n\nConclusion:", "response": "We consider the luminosity and environmental dependence of structural\nparameters of lenticular galaxies in the near-infrared K band.

By combining data from the literature for field and cluster\nlenticulars with our data, we study correlations between parameters that\ncharacterise the bulge and the disk as a function of luminosity and\nenvironment. We find that scaling relations such as the Kormendy relation,\nphotometric plane and other correlations involving bulge and disk parameters\nshow a luminosity dependence. This dependence can be explained in terms of\ngalaxy formation models in which faint lenticulars (M_T > -24.5) formed via\nsecular formation processes that likely formed the pseudobulges of late-type\ndisk galaxies, while brighter lenticulars (M_T < -24.5) formed through a\ndifferent formation mechanism most likely involving major mergers.

A group of roughly 40\nstars move in approximately circular orbits that ex-\ntend inward to a tenth of a parsec from the SBH\n(Paumard et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2008).\n\nConclusion:\nWe have found that the presence of an IBH orbiting\nwithin the nuclear star cluster at the center of the Milky\nWay can e\ufb03ciently randomize the orbits of stars near\nthe SBH, converting an initially thin, co-rotating disk\ninto a nearly isotropic distribution of stars moving on\neccentric orbits around the SBH. Randomization of the\norbital planes requires \u223c1 Myr if the IBH mass exceeds\n\u223c1500M\u2299and if the orbital eccentricity \u223c0.5 or greater.\nEvolution to a \u201cthermal\u201d eccentricity distribution occurs\non an even shorter time scale.\nThe \ufb01nal distribution\nof stellar semi-major axes depends on the assumed size\nof the IBH orbit, but stars with apastron distances as\nsmall as the periastron distance of the IBH are naturally\nproduced.\nOur simulations contribute only a small piece to the\nbigger unsolved puzzle of the origin of the young stars at\nthe galactic center. If models for the genesis of the S-stars\nthat invoke an inspiralling IBH are deemed otherwise vi-\nable, our results show how the same models can also nat-\nurally reproduce the random and eccentric character of\nthe stellar orbits, and all in a time that is less than stellar\nevolutionary time scales \u2013 thus providing an essentially\ncomplete explanation for the \u201cparadox of youth\u201d of the\nS-stars.\nAlthough we chose parameters for the IBH such that\ngravitational radiation would not alter its orbit apprecia-\nbly in 5 Myr, the rapidity with which the IBH modi\ufb01es\nthe stellar orbits in our simulations suggests that even\nan IBH on a decaying orbit might be able to randomize\nand \u201cthermalize\u201d the S-star distribution before coalesc-\ning with the SBH. Thus, our model does not necessarily\nimply that an IBH is present, at the current time, within\nthe S-star cluster. But if the IBH is there now, its pres-\nence might be detected in a number of ways:\n1.\nThe IBH will induce a motion of the SBH\n(Hansen and Milosavljevic 2003).\nUpper limits on the\nastrometric wobble of the radio source Sgr A\u2217are\nso far consistent with the presence of an IBH with\nmass and semi-major axis in the range considered here\n(Gillessen et al. 2008).\n2. Stars can remain bound to the IBH if its Hill sphere\nis larger than its tidal disruption sphere; this condition\nis satis\ufb01ed for SBH-IBH separations greater than \u223c0.05\nmpc.\nThe motion of a star bound to the IBH would\nbe the superposition of a Keplerian ellipse around the\nSBH and an additional periodic component due to its\nmotion around the IBH; the latter would have a velocity\namplitude \u223c0.1 \u221210 times the IBH orbital velocity and\nan orbital frequency from several hours to a few years,\npotentially accessible to astrometric monitoring.\n3. In favorable circumstances, a near encounter of the\nIBH with a star unbound to it could produce observable\nchanges in the star\u2019s orbit over month- or year-long time\nscales.\n4. In our simulations with q = 0.001 and e = (0.5, 0.7),\na fraction 13% of the stars were ejected from the SBH-\nIBH system in 5 Myr.\nA star ejected at \u223c103 km\ns\u22121 requires \u223c102 yr to move beyond 0.1 pc imply-\ning a probability \u223c0.2(N/104) of observing an escap-\ning star at any given time in the Galactic center region,\nwhere N is the number of stars subject to ejection. One\nS-star in fact appears to be on an escaping trajectory\n(Gillessen et al. 2008).\nFinally we note that some models for IBH formation\npredict that a large number of IBHs might co-exist in\nthe galactic center region (Portegies Zwart et al. 2006).\nIf so, the rate of orbital evolution of the young stars might\nbe even higher than what we observe in our simulations\nwith a single IBH.\nD.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. VII. Relative Ages':\n\nIntroduction:\nOne of the keys to understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way is the\nability to divide its stars and clusters into separate Galactic Populations as \ufb01rst hinted at by\nOort (1926) and formally introduced by Baade (1944). In the early 1950s, Sandage pub-\nlished the \ufb01rst deep color\u2212magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the northern Galactic globular\nclusters (GGCs) M3 and M92 (Sandage 1953; Arp, Baum, & Sandage 1953) and discovered\nthe faint sequence of stars similar to the main sequence of Population I. It was almost im-\nmediately realized that GGCs are ancient compared to the stars in the Solar Neighborhood.\nOver the last half century, it has become clear that GGCs are astronomical fossils\nproviding important information on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. One\ncharacteristic of GGCs that makes them so valuable is that they are the oldest Galactic\nobjects for which reliable ages can be measured.\nGGC ages are of great interest to a variety of cosmological and comogonical issues\nsince their absolute ages place a lower limit on the age of the Universe.\n\nConclusion:\nFigure 10 shows the GGC normalized ages derived using the D07 stellar evolution library\nas a function of [M/H] in the CG metallicity scale (upper panel), and as a function of the\ngalactocentric distance (rGC, lower panel). The low\u2212, intermediate\u2212and high\u2212metallicity\nsubgroups are separated by long dashed lines, and clusters belonging to the di\ufb00erent metal-\nlicity groups are plotted with open circles (low\u2212), \ufb01lled triangles (intermediate\u2212) and \ufb01lled\ncircles (high\u2212metallicity). The mean and dispersion of the low\u2212metallicity clusters\u2019 age are\nmarked with solid and dashed lines, respectively. For each of the three metallicity groups,\nmean age and rms is indicated. Figure 11 shows the same data as Figure 10, but for the ZW\nmetallicity scale.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nOverall, we notice an increase in age dispersion (which is model independent) with the\nmetallicity. However, we can look at the results shown in the upper panels of Figures 10\nand 11 in another way. They show two branches in the age\u2212metallicity relation of GGCs.\nOn one hand, a \u2019young\u2019 branch showing a clear age\u2212metallicity relation, age decreasing at\nhigher metallicities. On the other hand, a largely coeval \u2019old\u2019 branch. The \u2019old\u2019 branch shows\nan apparent relative age dispersion of \u223c0.05 and no age\u2212metallicity relation. It is worth\nmentioning that while the age\u2212metallicity relation may be model dependent (though it is\nsomehow reassuring that the four most recent theoretical libraries provide consistent results\non this respect) the age dispersion\u2212metallicity relation is not model dependent. From now\non, we will divide the clusters in two groups that we call \u2019young\u2019 and \u2019old\u2019. GGCs with total\nmetallicity higher than -1.4 and normalized age younger than 0.95, that is one sigma smaller\nthan the mean of the low\u2212metallicity clusters\u2019 age, are considered members of the \u2019young\u2019\ngroup. The remaining GGCs are considered members of the \u2019old\u2019 group. The only exception\nis NGC 6441, a very high metallicity cluster which is much closer to the old branch than the\nyoung one, so it is included in the old group. Column 10 in Table 4 lists whether the target\ncluster belongs to the old or young group.\nAn age trend with galactocentric distance is seen in the lower panels of Figures 10\nand 11. The fraction of young group\u2019s clusters increases signi\ufb01cantly as the galactocentric\ndistance increases. As a result, age dispersion increases at increasing galactocentric distance.\nOther authors have commented on the increased dispersion in ages at larger galactocentric\ndistances. (e. g. Richer et al. 1996, which is one of the \ufb01rst to state the empirical problem\nclearly). Also in these panels, a clear metallicity trend with galactocentric distance can be\nobserved for the old group of clusters, with an increasing metallicity at lower galactocentric\ndistances. This trend is explicitly shown in Figure 12, which plots GGC\u2019s [M/H] in the CG\nmetallicity scale as a function of the galactocentric distance. Open and \ufb01lled circles represent\nclusters in the young and old groups, respectively.\nIn the following, the age dispersion of the old clusters group, the age\u2212metallicity relation\nof the young clusters group and the age trend with galactocentric distance are discussed in\ndetail.\n7.1.\nThe age dispersion of the old clusters group\nFigures 10 and 11 indicate that the mean normalized age of the clusters in the old group\nis the same for all metallicities. The relative age dispersion of this group is \u223c0.05. If an\nabsolute age of 12.8 Gyr (from the D07 models) is assumed as the mean age of these clusters,\nage dispersion would be \u223c0.6 Gyr. We note that if we assume that all sources of uncertainty\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nhave been taken into account in the error bars, then at least part of this dispersion must be\nreal. The average normalized age uncertainty among the clusters in the old group is 0.04,\nwhich is approximately 0.5 Gyr. Subtracting this quadratically from the observed dispersion,\nwe \ufb01nd an intrinsic dispersion of 0.03 in relative age for the clusters in the old group. Using\n12.8 Gyr for the age of this group, the intrinsic dispersion is \u223c0.4 Gyr.\nThese results are consistent with a scenario in which the old group of clusters formed\nwithin a fast assembling process of the halo, lasting \u223c0.8 Gyr and which should also ac-\ncount for an increasing metallicity towards the center of the Galaxy. This implies that the\nchemical enrichment of the protogalactic cloud was faster than the assembling timescale.\nRegarding the nature of such assembling process, it is interesting to note the following.\nWilkinson & Evans (1999) estimate the mass and scalelength of the Milky Way dark mat-\nter halo to be \u223c1.9\u00d71012 M\u2299and 170 kpc, respectively. The free-fall time of a homogeneous\nsphere of those mass and radius is \u223c0.84 Gyr, similar to the age range we \ufb01nd here for the\nold clusters. In other words, the age dispersion of old globular clusters is not in contradiction\nwith the formation from the colapse of a single protosystem, resembling the model proposed\nby Eggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage (1962). On another side, the standard \u039bCDM scenario\nwould predict a general star formation, including star clusters, in protogalaxy building blocks\nof mass \u223c108 M\u2299before reionization (Moore et al. 2006). These blocks merge together af-\nterwards to form larger galaxies, and would, in principle, be compatible with the old, coeval\ncluster population that we observe. More di\ufb03cult seems to account for the metallicity gra-\ndient (Fig. 12) under this scenario. A more detailed analysis is necessary, but it is important\nto note that any successful galaxy formation scenario must account for the existence of a\nlarge nubmer of old, coeval globular clusters in the Milky Way.\n7.2.\nThe Age\u2212metallicity relation of the young clusters group\nClusters in the young group, however, show a clear age\u2212metallicity relationship, with\nyounger clusters being more metal rich than older ones. The nature of this \u201cyoung branch\u201d\ncan perhaps be better understood by looking at the GGCs associated with known or putative\naccreted dwarf galaxies: Sagittarius, Canis Major and Monoceros.\nIbata, Gilmore, & Irwin (1995) discovered the accreted Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and its\nGC system (Terzan 7, Terzan 8, Arp 2, and M54). Dinescu et al. (2000) and Bellazzini et al.\n(2003) have since then argued, respectively, that Pal 12 and NGC 4147 are part of the ex-\ntended tidal stream.\nThe Monoceros Ring was discovered by Newberg et al. (2002), and it has been pro-\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nposed to be the tidal stream of the accreted Monoceros galaxy. Crane et al. (2003) and\nFrinchaboy et al. (2004) identi\ufb01ed \ufb01ve possible GC candidates of this accreted galaxy: NGC\n2298, NGC 2808, NGC 5286, Pal 1, and BH 176. In addition, Martin et al. (2004) identify\nfour GGCs \u2013 NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 2298 and NGC 2808 \u2013 possibly associated with\na stellar overdensity in Canis Major, which they suspect to be a dwarf galaxy. However,\nthe nature of these two structures is controversial. The existence of the Canis Major dwarf\ngalaxy has been seriously questioned by Momany et al. (2004, 2006). In Momany et al.\n(2006), the Canis Major stellar over\u2212density has been completely accounted for as the e\ufb00ect\nof the Milky Way disk warp (an ubiquitous property of all massive galaxies). In addition,\nMomany et al. (2006) have shown that also the Monoceros Ring seems to re\ufb02ect the signa-\nture of another Galactic disk property; the \ufb02aring (the increase in scale-height as a function\nof Galactocentric distance) of the outer disk.\nFigures 13A and 13B show the age\u2212metallicity relation, using the CG metallicity scale6.\nSagittarius, Monoceros and Canis Major\u2019s clusters have been marked. It is interesting that,\nfor metallicities higher than [M/H] = -1.4, all of Sagittarius, Monoceros and Canis Major\u2019s\naccreted clusters fall in the young group, with the exception of NGC 5286, and they follow\nthe same age\u2212metallicity relation as the rest of the young group\u2019s clusters.\nThis result\nsuggests a di\ufb00erent origin for the old and young groups of clusters. It is worth mentioning\nthat there is a number of clusters, other than the Sagittarius, Monoceros and Canis Major\u2019s\nclusters among the young sample.\nAnother interesting question is related to the recent discovery that GGCs are not sim-\nple single stellar populations.\nThe high mass and multiple stellar populations of \u03c9Cen\nhas led to speculation that it is the remnant nucleus of an accreted Milky Way satellite\ngalaxy (Lee et al. 1999; Villanova et al. 2007). But \u03c9Cen is not a unique case. NGC 2808\n(Piotto et al. 2007), NGC 1851 (Milone et al. 2008a), NGC 6388 (Piotto 2008) and NGC\n6441 (Caloi & D\u2019Antona 2007) are four massive clusters hosting multiple stellar popula-\ntions. Freeman (1993) suggested that GGCs form as the nuclei of dwarf galaxies in the\nearly universe, and are accreted as their host galaxies merge onto larger structures. In this\ncontext, these peculiar GGCs would be good candidates to be the remnants of accreted\nsatellites. Multiple population clusters have been also marked in Figure 13A.\nWe note that multiple stellar population clusters have broadened MSTOs and at least\na fraction of the stars in these clusters have rather anomalous chemical compositions. For\nthis reason, we should be hesitant in adopting their relative ages obtained in this study. A\n6Because the results are equivalent to those using the ZW metallicity scale, we only consider the CG scale\nafter this point.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nmuch more detailed analysis is needed for these peculiar clusters. Villanova et al. (2007)\nand Cassisi et al. (2008) present particularly illuminating discussions of the di\ufb03culties in\nestimating ages for the multiple populations in \u03c9Cen and NGC 1851, respectively.\nFigure 13B shows the same Figure 13A, but here GGCs with rGC > 10 kpc have are\nrepresented with \ufb01lled circles, while those with rGC < 10 kpc are plotted with open circles.\nInterestingly, all intermediate\u2212and high\u2212metallicity clusters with rGC > 10 kpc fall on the\nyoung group of clusters.\nIn order to characterize the young group\u2019s age\u2212metallicity relation, a least squares \ufb01t\nhas been performed, and results are also shown in Figure 13B. The age\u2212metallicity relation\nobserved in the young group of clusters can be described by the equation:\nAgeNORM = \u22120.38[M/H] + 0.45\n(4)\nThis relation is plotted with a solid line in Figure 13B. The dispersion of the clusters\u2019\nrelative ages with respect to the previous equation is also 0.05, and it is also represented in\nFigure 13B (dashed lines). Following a similar argument as for the old group, if an absolute\nage of 12.8 Gyr is assumed as the mean of the clusters in the old group, the young group\u2019s\nage dispersion with respect to the previous age\u2212metallicity relation would be \u223c0.6 Gyr. The\naverage normalized age uncertainty among the clusters in the young group is 0.04, which is\napproximately 0.5 Gyr. Subtracting this quadratically from the observed dispersion, we \ufb01nd\nan intrinsic dispersion with respect to its age\u2212metallicity relation of 0.03 in relative age, or\n\u223c0.4 Gyr.\nIn summary, our results are consistent with the clusters of the young group having been\nformed in a di\ufb00erent process spanning an interval of time as long as 0.45 in relative age, or\n\u223c6 Gyr, and resulting in a group of GCs with a clear age\u2212metallicity relation. It is very\ntempting to argue that the origin of this second group of clusters is related to their formation\nwithin Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted. However, the reason why the\nage\u2212metallicity relation of the GGCs associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as well\nas Monoceros and Canis Major, is similar to that of the rest of \u2019accreted\u2019 clusters should\nbe investigated. Perhaps all of the young group clusters share the same origin, which would\nrequire an association between Sagittarius, Monoceros and Canis Major, or alternatively,\nall dwarf galaxy systems may share a common (or very similar) star formation and metal\nenrichment history, and hence a common age\u2212metallicity relation, which seems unlikely.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n7.3.\nAge trend with galactocentric distance\nWith the aim of analyzing in more detail the observed age trend with galactocentric\ndistance, GGCs in the old and young groups are considered separately. Figure 13C shows\nnormalized ages versus galactocentric distance (same as Figure 10, lower panel), but now\nclusters in the old group are represented with open circles and clusters in the young group\nwith \ufb01lled circles. Besides, Sagittarius, Monoceros and Canis Major\u2019s clusters are shown as\nencircled points.\nIt can be seen that if the old group is considered, an age trend with galactocentric dis-\ntance is not observed. The age\u2019s variance remains constant with the galactocentric distance\nfor this group.\nOn the other hand if the young group is taken into account, it can be seen that the\nage\u2019s variance increases with galactocentric distance. In order to determine if this variance\nincrease depends either on the galactocentric distance or the metallicity, a three dimensional\nprincipal\u2212component (PC) analysis has been done considering the clusters in the young\ngroup only. The obtained eigenvalues are 2.03, 0.83 and 0.14. The \ufb01rst PC, of eigenvalue\n2.03, accounts for 68% of the total variance. According to the commonly used average or\neigenvalue-one criterion, only this PC should be retained. Figure 14 shows the relations\nbetween the original data and PCs projected on the two \ufb01rst PCs plane. On the one hand\nit can be seen that the \ufb01rst PC is strongly correlated with [M/H] and age, but weakly with\nrGC, while the second PC carries on most of the rGC variance. On another hand it is clear\nthat young cluster age dispersion can be explained by an age\u2212metallicity relation and that\nage is not related to rGC.\nIn fact, the e\ufb00ect of metallicity on age of clusters in the young group can be eliminated\nby subtracting the \ufb01tted age\u2212metallicity relation (equation 4) to the cluster\u2019s ages.\nBy\ndoing this, age\u2212metallicity \u2019corrected\u2019 ages are obtained. Figure 13D shows the same as\nFigure 13C, but here age\u2212metallicity \u2019corrected\u2019 clusters are represented with solid circles.\nIt can be clearly seen that most of the age dispersion observed in Figure 13C disappears,\nand that age is not related to rGC\nIn summary, it can be concluded that a signi\ufb01cant part of the age dispersion present in\nFigure 13C for rGC \u226415 kpc and most of that for rGC > 15 can be explained by a strong\nage\u2212metallicity relation for the clusters of the young group.\nIt is worth mentioning that our database is biased in distance. No outer\u2212halo clusters,\nwith galactocentric distances larger than \u223c20 kpc, have been considered for this study. So\nthe analysis of the galactic halo\u2019s age structure is limited by the galactocentric distance range\nof the database. Given that outer\u2212halo clusters (Pal 3, Pal 4, Pal 14, Eridanus, AM-1) have\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nyounger ages (Sarajedini 1997; Stetson et al. 1999; Dotter et al. 2008), it is possible that\nour age range might be a lower limit on the actual range.\n8.\nConclusions\nNormalized ages have been derived for a sample of 64 GGCs using the stellar evolution\nmodels of D07 and both ZW and CG metallicity scales. We have also performed an analysis\nusing the stellar models of P04, B94 and G00. The result is the most extensive and precise\ndatabase of normalized ages so far produced . Our results are:\n\u2022 We \ufb01nd that we are able to measure relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. The\nrelative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. Four independent sets\nof stellar evolution libraries (D07, P04, B94, G00) produce essentially identical results.\n\u2022 We \ufb01nd that the GGCs fall into two well-de\ufb01ned groups. The \ufb01rst one represents\na population of old clusters that have the same age, a dispersion of 5% in relative\nage and no age\u2212metallicity relation. If we assume an absolute age of 12.8 Gyr, the\nabsolute age dispersion of the old clusters is \u223c0.6 Gyr. Accounting for the measurement\nuncertainties, we obtain an intrinsic age dispersion of \u223c0.4 Gyr. The second group of\nclusters shows a clear age\u2212metallicity relation, with young clusters being more metal\nrich than older ones. Also in this case, the intrinsic age dispersion with respect to its\nage\u2212metallicity relation is \u223c0.4 Gyr. Besides, there is no age dispersion\u2212metallicity\nrelation if we look at the two samples (old and young) separately.\n\u2022 These results are consistent with a scenario in which the formation of the Milky Way\nCCG system took place in two phases. The \ufb01rst one produced clusters with ages within\na range of \u223c0.8 Gyr. This age range is compatible with the timescale for the collapse of\na protogalaxy of the same mass and scalelength as that of the Milky Way dark matter\nhalo. In other words, the age dispersion of the old group of globular clusters is not in\ncontradiction with the formation from the colapse of a single protosystem, resembling\nthe model proposed by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage (1962). The standard \u039bCDM\nscenario would also predict a signi\ufb01cant star formation in protogalactic building blocks\nbefore reionization, which, after merging, would produce an old, coeval population of\nglobular clusters in a large galaxy like the Milky Way. However, to account for the\ngalactocentric metallicity gradient of this group seems di\ufb03cult in the context of this\nmechanism. The second phase spanned a time interval as long as \u223c6 Gyr and resulted\nin a group of GGCs with a clear age\u2212metallicity relation. It is very tempting to argue\nthat the origin of this second group of clusters is related to their formation within\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nMilky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted. However, this would not account\nfor the fact that the clusters of this group share the same age\u2212metallicity relation.\n\u2022 We \ufb01nd that the increasing dispersion in age with galactocentric distance is explained\nby the age\u2212metallicity relation of GGCs.\n\u2022 These results are independent of the assumed metallicity scale.\n\u2022 It is worth mentioning that our database is biased by distance. No outer halo clusters,\nwith galactocentric distances larger than \u223c20 kpc, have been considered.

As for the younger\nclusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their\nformation within Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but the\norigin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear."}

Keeping the density fluctuation up to\nthe second order, we obtain the nonlinear field equation of the 2-pt\ncorrelation \\xi(r), which contains the 3-pt correlation and formal ultra-violet\ndivergences. By the Groth-Peebles hierarchical ansatz and the mass\nrenormalization, the equation becomes closed with two new terms beyond the\nGaussian approximation, and their coefficients are taken as parameters.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'New BVRI photometry results on KBOs from the ESO VLT':\n\nIntroduction:\nTrans\u2013Neptunian objects (TNOs) are cold minor bodies composed of ice and rock that populate the region of the solar system\nbeyond Neptune. Their existence was hypothesized to explain the observed distribution of short-period comets (Fern\u00b4andez, 1980;\nDuncan et al. 1988). The \ufb01rst of these objects, besides Pluto, was discovered in 1992 by Jewitt & Luu (1993), and currently more\nthan 1000 of these objects have been detected.\nDynamical groups: The known TNOs comprise di\ufb00erent dynamical groups: classical objects which exhibit orbits with mod-\nerate eccentricities; resonant objects trapped by Neptune in mean motion resonances (the Plutinos being the most representative\npopulation, in the 3:2 resonance); scattered disk objects (SDOs) with orbits with high eccentricities and sometimes high inclina-\ntions, due to close encounters with the planet Neptune in the past. The classical group is sub-classi\ufb01ed in two sub-groups: The\nso-called (dynamically) hot classical objects with orbital inclinations > 4.5 \u25e6, and the (dynamically) cold classical objects, with\ninclinations < 4.5 \u25e6. Centaurs represent TNOs scattered towards the inner solar system and they reside between the orbits of Jupiter\nand Neptune, so many investigators consider them Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). The current scenarios of the Solar System forma-\ntion suggest that the KBOs, the short-period comets and some icy satellites of the major planets were formed in the transNeptunian\nbelt. What is known of their physical nature supports this idea. However, since the TNOs never appear in the vicinity of the Sun,\nthey are believed to be even more pristine than their relatives. The knowledge of the physico-chemical nature of TNOs may give\nimportant clues on the conditions prevailing at the time of their formation, mainly for the larger TNOs (some of which comply with\nthe dwarf-planet de\ufb01nition) which are the least collisionally evolved objects.\nColour census of TNOs: Over the past years the sample of TNOs with BVRI colors measured has grown to more than 100\nobjects. Statistical analyses suggest the presence of various correlations among the color and dynamical properties of classical TNOs\nand SDOs, while Plutinos and Centaurs appear to be heterogeneous and without obvious relations between physical and dynamical\nparameters of the objects. From BVRI color studies Tegler & Romanishin (2000) suggested the existence of a group of red classical\n\nConclusion:\n\u2013 BVRI photometry results on 32 KBOs with ESO/VLT telescope are presented (colors and absolute magnitudes). Merging our\nphotometric results with the ESO and 2MS data sets, we obtain a large and rather homogeneous sample of 116 objects that is\nused for statistical analysis of correlations between colors and/or orbital parameters of the objects.\n\u2013 We found short-term brightness variability due to rotation in 11 of the 32 objects studied. While the percentage of objects with\nvery high amplitudes is similar to results published before, our sample has a higher fraction of objects with medium to small\namplitude variations. Since our sample includes objects with fainter magnitudes (i.e. smaller sizes) than previous studies, we\ntentatively conclude that smaller objects have, on average, more irregular shapes than larger ones. Independent con\ufb01rmation of\nthis conclusion with a much larger sample is highly desirable.\n\u2013 Our average spectral gradient calculations are compatible with previous results:\nGrtavg(Class, n=73)=22.9 \u00b1 9.8%/100 nm\nGrtavg(Hot, n=42)=19.6 \u00b1 8.5%/100 nm\nGrtavg(Cold, n=31)=27.4 \u00b1 11.3%/100 nm\nGrtavg(SDOs, n=25)=18.6 \u00b1 7.6%/100 nm\nGrtavg(Cent, n=18)=19.8 \u00b1 6.7%/100 nm\n\u2013 We obtain color vs. perihelion distance correlations, and color vs. inclination and eccentricity anticorrelations for the classi-\ncal TNOs. These results imply that the redder classical objects have low inclinations and eccentricities, and high perihelion\ndistances. This interpretation supports the existence of a cold red cluster of classical objects in very circular orbits with low\ninclinations, and possibly supports an ice resurfacing scenario that depends on the solar distance.\n\u2013 A size dependence of the correlation of colors versus semimajor axis is found in classical objects. We use an absolute magnitude\ncutto\ufb00value of HR=6.2. For the large objects (HR <6.2, D>190 km, assuming pR=0.12) the redder ones have the larger semi-\nmajor axes. This result could support a possible resurfacing mechanism depending on semimajor axis. The large objects sizes\nmight allow them to develop a bound coma, and perhaps a coloring mechanism due to sublimation, and recondensation can take\nplace. No apparent dependence on sizes of the correlations of colors versus perihelion distances, inclination or eccentricity are\nfound for classical objects.\n\u2013 We \ufb01nd in the hot (i> 4.5 \u25e6) classical objects that the redder ones have the larger perihelion distances, and the lower orbital\ninclinations. We \ufb01nd that correlations of color versus perihelion distance, aphelion distance and semimajor axis depend on size:\nthese correlations increase for the larger (D> 190 km) hot classical objects. These results support a coloring mechanism that\ndepends on solar distance and size.\n\u2013 Two possible color versus semimajor axis, and perihelion distance correlations are found for the cold (i< 4.5 \u25e6) group. These\nresults seem to have a relevant dependence on sizes: the smaller (D< 190 km) cold classical objects correlate better with\nperihelion and semimajor axis than the bigger ones. In other words, the smaller redder cold objects would have higher semimajor\naxe and perihelion distances. So, it seems there is a solar distance dependent coloring mechanism di\ufb00erent to ice resurfacing\nfrom sublimation and redeposition for the smaller cold objects (the small mass does not permit the development of a bound\ncoma).\n\u2013 A possible di\ufb00erent primordial origin for the hot and cold populations is consistent with our correlations and statistical analysis.\nWe \ufb01nd seven higher correlations for the hot group than for the classical one. The V-R vs. a correlation presents an opposite\ntrend in size for the hot and cold groups: for the hot objects the V-R vs. semimajor axis increases for the larger ones (HR <6.2,\nD>190 km), and for the cold objects it increases for the smaller ones (HR >6.2, D<190 km).\n\u2013 The SDOs with higher absolute magnitudes (i.e. the smaller ones), lower inclinations and perihelion distances, and higher\neccentricities are the bluer ones. A possible physical process that may produce such a coloring scheme is currently unknown to\nus.\n\u2013 The Centaurs with higher inclinations, lower eccentricities, smaller sizes and lower semimajor axis are the bluer ones. This\nresult is opposite to that obtained for the SDOs, so the coloring mechanism for Centaurs and SDOs must be di\ufb00erent.\n\u2013 We do not \ufb01nd relevant di\ufb00erences between the statistical results for merged groups (i.e. SDOs+hot, SDOs+Cent), so this\ncannot be used to link di\ufb00erent dynamical groups or to say something about a possible common origin and/or evolutionary\nrelation between these di\ufb00erent dynamical groups.\nAcknowledgements.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'High Inclination Planets in Multistellar Systems':\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Kozai instability is a well-known destabilizing mechanism of\nhigh inclination satellites. Arnold (1990), in his book Huygens &\nBarrow, Newton & Hooke, reports a neat illustration due to Lidov\n(1963). Lidov discovered that if the orbit of the Moon is turned\nthrough 90\u25e6, its eccentricity increases so rapidly under the action\nof the tidal forces of the Sun that it collides with the Earth in\nfour years! The effect was described and analysed by Kozai (1962,\n1980) in his studies of the survival of high inclination comets and\nasteroids.\nThe Kozai mechanism is a secular effect whereby, above a\ncritical inclination icrit of around 40\u25e6(depending on the system),\nthe inclination i is coupled to eccentricity e though the Kozai con-\nstant (see e.g., Thomas & Morbidelli 1996)\n\nConclusion:\nThis paper presents a foray into an area of dynamics that has not\nbeen extensively studied, namely small particles around a highly\neccentric binary star in a hierarchical triple system. At outset, such\nparticles might be expected to be disrupted by the Kozai instability.\nHere, we have demonstrated the existence of stable, high in-\nclination circumbinary test particles. They owe their stability to the\nhigh eccentricity of the inner binary. This is somewhat surprising,\nas it goes against every expectation of planetary dynamics. The in-\nner binary, instead of inducing Kozai cycles, causes smooth incli-\nnation variations and nodal precession for certain initial longitudes.\nThis suppresses Kozai cycles that would otherwise occur due to the\nouter star in the hierarchical triple.\nAn analytical theory to explain these variations is desirable.\nHowever, the stars are very eccentric, their mass ratio is high, and\nthe test particle\u2019s inclination is also large, leaving no obvious small\nparameters for the standard perturbation expansions of celestial me-\nchanics. The semimajor axis ratios are not very small, but do not\nexplain why existing secular theories (e.g. Kozai 1962; Ford et al.\n2000) are unable to describe the dynamics. The libration islands,\ninclination variations and critical initial inclination are surprisingly\nfamiliar to, but contrasting with, the dynamics of the Kozai mech-\nanism. The Kozai mechanism occurs if \u02d9\u03c9 \u22480, whereas the nodal\nlibration appears to be a similar process occurring when \u02d9\u2126\u22480.\nc\u20dd0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nHigh Inclination Planets in Multistellar Systems\n7\nThere exists an approximate integral of motion \u2013 namely, the test\nparticle\u2019s component of angular momentum along the direction of\nthe line of apses of the binary star\u2019s orbit. This also is analogous\nto the Kozai mechanism, which has an approximate integral of mo-\ntion.\nThe high inclination libration feature may have important con-\nsequences for planetary stability in circumbinary orbits. Many stel-\nlar members of triples have exchanged into the system, so high mu-\ntual planet-star inclinations are very likely. If there are regions of\nstability then the outlook for planetary systems in these environ-\nments is more promising than previously thought.", "response": "The Kozai mechanism often destabilises high inclination orbits. It couples\nchanges in the eccentricity and inclination, and drives high inclination,\ncircular orbits to low inclination, eccentric orbits. In a recent study of the\ndynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD98800 (Verrier & Evans\n2008), there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar\norbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai\ninstability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through\nnumerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of\nthe outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary\npair on a shorter timescale. By empirically modelling the period of the\nlibration, a criteria for determining the high inclination stability limits in\ngeneral triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting\nand, although effecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the\nKozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high inclination planets and\nasteroids may be able to survive in multistellar systems."}

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Holography, UV/IR Relation, Causal Entropy Bound and Dark Energy':\n\nIntroduction:\nSince the discovery of accelerating expansion of the universe by observing distant super-\nnova [1, 2], the nature of dark energy has been one of the hottest issues in cosmology\nand theoretical physics. Now a lot of astronomical observations indicate that the energy\nbudget of the universe consists of approximately 4% baryon matter, 23% dark matter,\n73% dark energy and negligible radiation. The simplest and economic way to explain the\naccelerating expansion of the universe is due to a tiny positive cosmological constant in-\ntroduced \ufb01rst by Einstein himself in 1917. It is well-known that the cosmological constant\nand the vacuum expectation value of some quantum \ufb01elds are undistinguished. Thus, the\ncosmological constant acting as the solution of the dark energy su\ufb00ers from the so-called\n\ufb01ne tuning problem: what is the physical mechanism that sets the value of the cosmolog-\nical constant to its current observed value, which is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe naive theoretical expectation. Also there exists the so-called coincidence problem for\ndark energy: why does the cosmological constant dominate the universe just recently. In\nother words, the coincidence problem can also be expressed as follows. Why the energy\ndensities of dark energy and dark matter are comparable just recently?\nSince the cosmological constant is entangled with the vacuum expectation value of\nsome quantum \ufb01elds, the cosmological constant problem therefore is essentially an issue\nof quantum gravity. Indeed, general relativity together with quantum \ufb01eld theory could\nshed some lights on the cosmological constant problem.\nIt is widely believed and precisely tested that particle physics can be accurately de-\nscribed by an e\ufb00ective \ufb01eld theory with an ultraviolet (UV) cuto\ufb00less than the Planck\nmass Mp, provided that all momenta and \ufb01eld strengths are small compared with this cut-\no\ufb00to the appropriate power [3]. This is indeed the case in the absence of gravity. When\ngravity e\ufb00ect is taken into account, however, something very strange appears. Black hole\nthermodynamics tells us that a black hole has an entropy proportional to its horizon\narea. In Einstein gravity theory, black hole entropy satis\ufb01es the so-called area formula,\nS = A/4G, where A is the horizon area of the black hole and G is the Newtonian constant.\nOne learns from statistical physics that entropy of a system describes the number of mi-\ncroscopic degrees of freedom of the system, and that entropy is an extensive quantity and\nis always proportional to volume of the system. For a black hole, entropy is proportional\nto its area. This implies that for a gravity system, its e\ufb00ective degrees of freedom are\ndrastically reduced, compared to the same system without gravity. This indicates that\nthe underlying theory describing the nature must be not a local quantum \ufb01eld theory. In\nother words, there exists a range of validity for a local e\ufb00ective \ufb01eld theory to describe a\n2\nsystem with gravity. This leads to it unbelievable that the cosmological constant should\nbe in the order of Planck mass, obtained from the naive estimate of local e\ufb00ective \ufb01eld\ntheory without taking into account the gravity e\ufb00ect.\nTo realize this argument, Cohen et al. [3] proposed a relation between UV and infrared\n(IR) cuto\ufb00s. To be self-contained, let us brie\ufb02y repeat some key steps to the relation.\nFor an e\ufb00ective quantum \ufb01eld theory con\ufb01ned in a box of size L with UV cuto\ufb00\u039b, the\nentropy should scale extensively as S \u223cL3\u039b3. However, black hole thermodynamics leads\nBekenstein to argue that the maximal entropy of the box with volume L3 scales as its\narea, instead of the volume L3. The Bekenstein entropy bound could be satis\ufb01ed for an\ne\ufb00ective local quantum \ufb01eld theory if the following inequality is obeyed\n\nConclusion:\nFrom holographical property of gravity, one has the so-called UV/IR relation. The dark\nenergy problem is an IR problem, while the cosmological constant problem is an UV\nproblem. It is therefore natural to make a connection between the UV/IR relation and\nthe dark energy problem. The casual entropy bound for a spatial region in a cosmological\nsetting is given by assuming the maximal black hole in the universe is formed by gravita-\ntional collapse with the \u201cJeans\u201d scale of perturbations, beyond which black hole cannot\nform very likely. Therefore the \u201cJeans\u201d scale of perturbations in the universe naturally\nleads to an IR cuto\ufb00in the cosmological setup.\nThe causal connection scale is given by R\u22121\nCC =\nq\nMax( \u02d9H + H2, \u2212\u02d9H) for gravitational\nperturbation in a FRW universe [16]. We studied the cosmological dynamics of the vacuum\nenergy density by choosing the causal connection scale as the IR cuto\ufb00in the UV/IR\nrelation, in the cases of R\u22122\nCC = \u02d9H +2H2 and R\u22122\nCC = \u2212\u02d9H, respectively. Also we separately\nconsidered the cases of the corresponding vacuum density as an independently conserved\nenergy component and as an e\ufb00ective dynamical cosmological constant. It turns out only\nthe case with the choice R\u22122\nCC = \u02d9H + 2H2 could be consistent with current cosmological\ndata if it acts as the observed dark energy. This model is called holographic Ricci scalar\nmodel in the literature since R\u22122\nCC is proportional to the Ricci scalar of the FRW spacetime\nin this case. As a result, it appears that the causal connection scale acts as a new IR\ncuto\ufb00in the cosmological setting. It is of some interesting to investigate other cosmological\n13\nconsequences for this model. Finally let us stress that our discussions do not exclude some\ninteraction between the vacuum energy density and dark matter if \u2126\u039b \u0338= \u22121 in (3.2).", "response": "The constraint on the total energy in a given spatial region is given from\nholography by the mass of a black hole which just fits in that region, which\nleads to an UV/IR relation: the maximal energy density in that region is\nproportional to $M_p^2/L^2$, where $M_p$ is the Planck mass and $L$ is the\nspatial scale of that region under consideration. Assuming the maximal black\nhole in the universe is formed through gravitational collapse of perturbations\nin the universe, then the \"Jeans\" scale of the perturbations gives a causal\nconnection scale $R_{\\rm CC}$. For gravitational perturbations, $R^{-2}_{\\rm\nCC}={\\rm Max}(\\dot H+2H^2, -\\dot H)$ for a flat universe. We study the\ncosmological dynamics of the corresponding vacuum energy density by choosing\nthe causal connection scale as the IR cutoff in the UV/IR relation, in the\ncases of the vacuum energy density as an independently conserved energy\ncomponent and an effective dynamical cosmological constant, respectively. It\nturns out that only the case with the choice $R_{\\rm CC}^{-2}= \\dot H +2H^2$,\ncould be consistent with the current cosmological observations when the vacuum\ndensity appears as an independently conserved energy component.

These have a direct impact on the\nturnaround, virialisation and collapse times, altering in consequence the\nnon--linear density contrast and virial radius. We compute halo concentrations\nusing the Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz algorithm, examining two extreme scenarios:\nfirst, we assume that the quintessence field does not exhibit fluctuations on\ncluster scales and below - homogeneous fluid; second, we assume that the field\ninside the overdensity collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous\nfluid. The Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz prescription reveals, in general, higher\nhalo concentrations in inhomogeneous dark energy models than in their\nhomogeneous equivalents. Halo concentrations appear to be controlled by both\nchanges in formation epochs of the halo cores as well as by differing\nvirialisation overdensities.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Black Holes Admitting Strong Resonant Phenomena':\n\nIntroduction:\nQuasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of X-ray brightness had been observed in many\nGalactic low-mass X-ray binaries containing neutron stars (see, e.g.,van der Klis 2000,\n2006, Barret et al. 2005, Belloni et al. 2005, 2007) or black holes (see, e.g.,McClintock\nand Remillard 2004, Remillard 2005, Remillard and McClintock 2006). Some of the\nQPOs are in the kHz range and often come in pairs (\u03bdupp,\u03bddown) of twin peaks (often\ncalled double peaks) in the Fourier power spectra. Since the peaks of high frequencies\nare close to the orbital frequency of the marginally stable circular orbit representing the\ninner edge of Keplerian discs orbiting black holes (or neutron stars), the strong gravi-\nty effects have to be relevant in explaining high-frequency QPOs (Abramowicz et al.\n2004).\nThe twin peak QPOs were observed in four microquasars, namely GRO 1655-40,\nXTE 1550-564, H 1743-322, GRS 1915+105 (T\u00a8or\u00a8ok et al. 2005). In all of the four\ncases, the frequency ratio of the twin peaks is very close to 3 : 2 and the orbital reso-\nnance model assuming non-linear resonances between oscillations in Keplerian \u03bdK and\nepicyclic frequencies \u03bd\u03b8 (vertical), or \u03bdr (radial), or their combinations, seems to be the\npotential explanation of the microquasar kHz QPOs. The resonances of oscillations\nwith the epicyclic frequencies were \ufb01rstly mentioned in Aliev and Galtsov (1981). In\nthe context of QPOs observed in the neutron star and black hole systems, the orbital\nresonance model was introduced and developed by Klu\u00b4zniak and Abramowicz (2000),\nsee Abramowicz et al. (2004).\nAccording to the resonance hypothesis, the two modes in resonance should have\neigenfrequencies \u03bdr (equal to the radial epicyclic frequency) and \u03bdv (equal to the ver-\ntical epicyclic frequency \u03bd\u03b8 or to the Keplerian frequency \u03bdK). While models based\n2\non the parametric resonance identify the two observed frequencies of the twin peaks\n(\u03bdupp, \u03bddown) directly with the eigenfrequencies of a resonance, models based on the\nforced resonance allow to observe combinational (beat) frequencies of the modes, or\noscillations with the combinational frequencies entering the resonance (Landau and\nLifshitz 1976). Both parametric and forced resonance models make clear and precise\npredictions about the values of observed frequencies in connection with spin and mass\nof the observed object, at least in the case of black holes (T\u00a8or\u00a8ok et al. 2005).\nIn some sources, more than two high-frequency peaks are observed. The micro-\nquasar GRS 1915+105 reveals high-frequency QPOs appearing at four frequencies\nwith the lower and upper pairs in the ratio close to 3 : 2 (Remillard and McClintock\n2006) and even a \ufb01fth frequency was reported (Belloni et al. 2001). An additional\nsixth frequency was mentioned (Strohmayer 2001), although not con\ufb01rmed. In Sgr A\u2217,\nthree frequencies were reported with ratio close to 3 : 2 : 1 (Aschenbach 2004, Aschen-\nbach et al. 2004, T\u00a8or\u00a8ok 2005). In the galactic nuclei MCG-6-30-15 and NGC 4051,\ntwo pairs of QPOs were reported with the ratios close to 3 : 2 and 2 : 1, respectively (La-\nchowicz et al. 2006). In the source NGC 5408 X-1 oscillations with three frequencies\nof ratio close to 6 : 4 : 3 were observed (Strohmayer et al. 2007).\nIn the microquasar GRS1915+105, an almost extreme Kerr black hole with a \u22481\nis expected (McClintock et al. 2006), and all the \ufb01ve (six) frequencies of QPOs can be\nexplained in the framework of the extended resonance model with the hump-induced\noscillations, predicting the black hole spin a = 0.9998 and its mass M = 14.8 M\u2299\n(Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2006, 2007d). In the extended resonance model, forced resonances\nof the epicyclic oscillations with an additional oscillation induced by the humpy or-\nbital velocity pro\ufb01le (related to the physically privileged locally non-rotating frames)\nthat occurs in Keplerian discs orbiting Kerr black holes with a > 0.9953 are assumed\n(Aschenbach 2004, 2006, Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2004, 2005, 2007c). In the \u201chumpy\u201d extended\nresonance model, all the oscillations in resonance can occur at, and be related to the\nexclusively de\ufb01ned, \u201chumpy radius\u201d with extremal orbital velocity gradient within the\nhumpy pro\ufb01le (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2007c). However, this model can be relevant only for\nnear-extreme Kerr black holes with spin a > 0.9953 for Keplerian discs, and with even\nhigher spin a>0.9998 for marginally stable thick accretion discs (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2004,\n2005).\nIn order to explain complex frequency structures observed in some black hole sys-\ntems, we expect that more than one resonance occur in a Keplerian disc, and different\nversions of the orbital resonance model could be acting. Of course, one version of the\norbital resonance model appearing at different resonant points, at different radii of the\ndisc, is also possible (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k and T\u00a8or\u00a8ok 2005). Note that the so called total preces-\nsion resonance model, assuming resonance of oscillations with the Keplerian frequency\n\u03bdK and the total precession frequency \u03bdT = \u03bd\u03b8 \u2212\u03bdr, can explain quite well the multi-\nresonant phenomena observed in the neutron star atoll source 4U 1636-53 (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et\nal. 2007e) and in some other atoll sources (Bakala et al. 2008, in preparation).\nGenerally, two resonances could occur at different radii, and for special values of\nthe dimensionless spin a, the bottom, top, or mixed frequencies coincide, reducing two\nfrequency pairs into a triple frequency set (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2007b). Physically more in-\nteresting seems to be the case, when a triple frequency set \u03bdK, \u03bd\u03b8, \u03bdr with rational ratio\narises at a given radius. The resonant phenomena can be then expected stronger than in\nthe case of internally independent resonances occurring at two different radii. Clearly,\nwhile sharing a given radius, the resonances could be causally related and could co-\noperate ef\ufb01ciently (Landau and Lifshitz 1976). That is the reason why we focus here\nattention on the possibility of causally related resonances appearing at a \ufb01xed radius.\nSuch a situation is possible only in the \ufb01eld of Kerr black holes with special values of\nthe dimensionless spin a, when the value of a is related to the corresponding triple fre-\n3\nquency ratio set, and concrete versions of the resonance model that are realized. Since\nthe strength of the resonance and the resonant frequency width decrease rapidly with\nthe order of the resonance n + m (see Landau and Lifshitz 1976), in the following we\nrestrict ourselves to the cases with n, m\u22645.\n\nConclusion:\nWe present the possibilities for strong resonant phenomena arising in a shared radius\nin the \ufb01eld of black holes with spin appropriately tuned. We assume that the strong\nresonances could occur and in\ufb02uence each other causally, if \u03bdK : \u03bd\u03b8 : \u03bdr is in ratio of\nsmall integers s:t :u with s\u22645, when the order of the resonances could be low enough\nin order to enable strong resonance with relatively wide resonance frequency width\n(Landau and Lifshitz 1976). The strong resonances with lowest values of the frequency\nratio occur for the extraordinary resonant spin a3:2:1 = 0.983.\nDue to the allowed frequency detuning in the resonant phenomena (with maximal\nrelative frequency detuning limited to few percent), the strong resonant phenomena\ncould appear in black holes with spin values concentrated around the special resonant\nspin values. For a given relative frequency detuning \u03b4, the spin scatter differs for dif-\nferent special resonant spin values, being dependent on the position of the resonant\nradius (and the gradient of the frequency pro\ufb01les at this radius), see Table 1. In the\nmost interesting case of the extraordinary resonant spin a3:2:1 = 0.983, the spin scatter\n\u2248\u00b10.003 for detuning \u03b4 = 0.01 gives probably a realistic interval of black hole spins\nwhere the strong resonant phenomena could be observable. Of course, the value of \u03b4\n(and the spin value scatter) depend on physical conditions and resonant phenomena in\nconcrete sources and have to be discussed carefully for each individual source.\nThere is an indication that the QPOs data observed in the Galactic centre source\nSgr A\u2217imply the black hole spin close to the extraordinary resonant value of a\u22480.983,\nwhen \u03bdK :\u03bd\u03b8 :\u03bdr = 3 : 2 : 1 holds at the radius x3:2:1 =2.395 and the black hole mass can\nbe estimated to be in the interval of (4.8 \u00b1 0.5)\u00d7 106 M\u2299. Therefore, it is interesting\nto check concordance of the QPOs observation induced data with a variety of the other\nobservations of the Sgr A\u2217. It should be stressed that more precise measurement of\nthe QPOs frequencies will enable more precise determination of the black hole mass.\nMoreover, we expect NGC 5408 X-1 to be another candidate for a black hole admitting\nstrong resonant phenomena because of the observed frequency set (Strohmayer et al.\n2007).\nIt is important from the principal reason to note that if a black hole with appropri-\nately tuned spin a admits strong resonant phenomena with different resonances sharing\nthe same radius of the accretion disc, we could expect observable QPOs at resonant\nfrequencies even in situations when the internal disc conditions are not convenient\nfor starting up resonant phenomena, as observed, e.g.,in Sgr A\u2217source (Genzel et al.\n2003).\nOn the other hand, the four (or \ufb01ve) QPOs frequencies observed in the microquasar\nGRS 1915+105 can not be explained by the strong resonances model because of spe-\nci\ufb01c distribution of the observed frequency ratios (two different pairs of frequencies\nwith 3 : 2 ratio). In this case, the extended resonant model including the so called\nhumpy oscillations induced by the \u201chumpy\u201d velocity pro\ufb01le of the accretion disc, as\nmeasured in the privileged family of locally non-rotating frames, can explain all the\nobserved frequencies, if the black hole parameters are \ufb01xed at the spin a \u22480.9998 and\nthe mass M \u224814.4 M\u2299(Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2007c), in agreement with the spectral \ufb01t of the\nspin a \u22481 (McClintock et al. 2006).\nThe conditions for strong resonant phenomena could be realized only for black\nholes with high values of dimensionless spin (a \u22650.75). Therefore, the idea of strong\nresonant phenomena probably could not be extended to the neutron star systems, where\nwe expect spin a<0.5, at least if the Hartle\u2013Thorne metric parameters corresponding to\nthe spin a and the quadrupole momentum q are close to the quasi-Kerr values with q\u223c\nj2. Note that for the neutron star systems probably another version of the multiresonant\nidea could be realized in close agreement with observational data, where the so called\n15\ntotal precession resonance model with resonant frequencies \u03bdK and \u03bd\u03b8 \u2212\u03bdr (related to\nthe relativistic precession model, Stella and Vietri 1998) is involved and realized at\ndifferent radii, as shown in Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. (2007e).\nIn the \ufb01eld of Kerr black holes with a\u22480.866, the four frequency set ratio 4 : 3 : 2 : 1\ncould be observed, if the resonant conditions allow combinational frequencies to be\nobservable. For the spin a\u22480.962 or a\u22480.882, even the \ufb01ve frequency set 5 : 4 : 3 : 2 : 1\ncould be observable in some special circumstances. Clearly, it is not necessary that\nall the resonances are realized simultaneously and that the full \ufb01ve frequency set is\nobserved at the same time.\nUndoubtly, it is worth to search for such special cases of frequency sets in observa-\ntional data as these could lead to precise determination of the black hole spin enabling a\ndeeper understanding of a variety of astrophysical phenomena involved in determining\nbehaviour of accretion discs in strong gravitational \ufb01elds. We should note that when\nsimple combinational frequencies not exceeding the Keplerian frequency are allowed,\nthe lowest triple frequency ratio set 3 : 2 : 1 can be realized for black holes with the ex-\ntraordinary resonant spin a\u22480.983, but also for the black holes with three other values\nof the spin a = 0.866,0.882,0.962, if the uppermost frequencies are not observed for\nsome reasons.\nFinally, it has to be stressed that observation of some characteristic frequency sets\nwith low integer ratio could be a signature of a speci\ufb01c value of the black hole spin a\nenabling strong resonances at a \ufb01xed radius. However, generally, there exist few values\nof the spin a and the corresponding shared resonance radius allowed for a given fre-\nquency ratio set (Stuchl\u00b4\u0131k et al. 2007b). Therefore, detailed analysis of the resonance\nphenomena, including the resonance strength and resonant frequency width, has to be\nconsidered in a concrete candidate system, and it has to be further confronted with the\nspin estimates coming from spectral analysis of the black hole system as given, e.g.,in\nMcClintock et al. (2006) and Middleton et al. (2006) for GRS 1915+105, and Shafee\net al. (2006) for GRO J1655-40, the line pro\ufb01les (Fabian and Miniutti 2005, Dov\u02c7ciak et\nal. 2004, Zakharov 2003, Zakharov and Repin 2006), and the orbital periastron preces-\nsion of some stars moving in the region of Sgr A\u2217(Kraniotis 2005, 2007), in order to\nestablish the black hole spin. Very promising from this point of view seem to be studies\nof the energy dependencies of high-frequency QPO determining the QPO spectra at the\nQPO radii (\u02d9Zycki et al. 2007) as they could be credited by the strong resonance condi-\ntions giving precisely the black hole spin and the radius where the observed QPOs are\ngenerated.\nAcknowledgements.

However, the unknown expansion\nvelocity error adds additional uncertainties to the estimate of\nMe j\nH . Figure2 shows the range of Me j\nH for di\ufb00erent expansion\nvelocities as a function of the SSS appearance time.\nThe turn-o\ufb00time of the SSS phase allows us to estimate the\namount of hydrogen-rich material burned on the WD surface,\nMburn = (L\u2206t)/(XH\u01eb), where L is the bolometric luminosity, \u2206t\nthe duration of the SSS phase, XH the hydrogen fraction of the\nburned material, and \u01eb = 5.98 \u00d7 1018 erg g\u22121.

It is noteworthy that this is within a factor 2\u20133 the\nsame as the ejected mass. We used typical values for L and XH,\nsince we do not know the actual values for M31N 2007-11a .\nM31N 2007-11a has the shortest SSS phase observed so far,\nwhich can be caused either by a WD with MWD > 1.1 M\u2299for a\nstandard hydrogen fraction in the envelope or by very hydrogen-\npoor envelope in a WD with MWD \u223c1.0 M\u2299. The mass of the\nstable H-burning envelope decreases with increasing WD mass,\nwith massive WDs showing the shortest SSS phases. Massive\nWDs also eject less massive shells during outburst, leading to a\nfaster rise in the SSS emission.\nFrom the optical light curve we \ufb01nd a decline rate of \u223c0.6\nmag/d. Extrapolating the magnitude to the day before the \ufb01rst\nobservation (MJD = 54405.3) leads to an estimated maximum\nmagnitude of mR \u223c16.1, which implies an absolute magni-\ntude at maximum of MR \u223c\u22128.4 \u00b1 0.4 at the distance of M 31.\nWithin the uncertainties, this value matches the maximum mag-\nnitude versus rate of decline (MMRD) relationship obtained\nby Della Valle & Livio (1995). Assuming that the strength of\na nova outburst (for a given temperature of the WD and ac-\ncretion rate) mostly depends on the mass of the WD (see e.g.\nLivio 1992; Della Valle & Livio 1995; Della Valle 2002, and ref-\nerences therein), one can estimate WD masses from optical nova\nlight curves. However, Livio (1992) mentions that great caution\nshould be exercised when applying his maximum magnitude vs.\nWD mass relation to individual novae, since there are weaker\ndependences of the nova luminosity on the magnetic \ufb01eld of\nthe WD and the enrichment of the envelope by heavy elements,\nwhich are neglected in his formula. Using our optical light curve,\nwe compute thatM31N 2007-11a likely originated from a WD\nwith MWD \u223c0.9\u20131.15 M\u2299. This result is consistent with the X-\nray observations.\nAs mentioned before, many of the novae with known short\nSSS phases turned out to be RNe. To check for the possibility\nthat M31N 2007-11a is an RN, we looked for historical novae\nwith positions close to M31N 2007-11a. In the compiled on-\nline nova catalog of Pietsch et al. (2007b)3 there are two his-\ntorical novae within a radius of \u223c20\u2032\u2032 around M31N 2007-\n11a. Sharov et al. (2000) found a nova (M31N 1998-07n) at\na distance of about 15\u2032\u2032, and Hubble (1929) reported a nova\n(M31N 1920-10a) at a distance of about 20\u2032\u2032 to M31N 2007-\n11a. The J2000 coordinates of M31N 1920-10a were taken from\nthe Combined General Catalogue of Variable Stars (Samus et al.\n2004). From the \ufb01nding chart given by Sharov et al. (2000), nova\nM31N 1998-07n and M31N 2007-11a do not seem to be iden-\ntical. This agrees with the position accuracy of 0 .\u2032\u20325 given by\nSharov et al. (2000). For M31N 1920-10a no \ufb01nding chart exists\nand the position given by Hubble (1929) has a minimum accu-\nracy of 0 .\u20321. The actual unknown position accuracy of historical\nnovae leaves the (small) possibility open that both novae in fact\noriginated on the same WD. A relatively large position error for\na historical nova could be possible, since e.g. the re-analysis of\nphotographic plates by Henze et al. (2008) gives several exam-\nples for historical novae with position errors of \u223c20\u2032\u2032 or more.\nClari\ufb01cation of this point could only come from re-examination\nof the original photographic plates used in the work of Hubble\n(1929).\n3 http://www.mpe.mpg.de/\u223cm31novae/opt/m31/index.php\nM.

Similar conclusions can be\ndrawn here for the linear-momentum \ufb02ux.\nThe PN expressions for the linear-momentum \ufb02ux can\nbe used to grasp which asymmetry in the parameter\nspace can produce the recoil velocity, or suggest phe-\nnomenological formulas describing numerical-relativity\nresults [19, 21, 24, 27]. However, not surprisingly, the fast\nincrease during the late inspiral and plunge, and the arbi-\ntrariness in determining until when those formula should\nbe trusted, make the PN predictions not very accurate\nand robust for predicting the recoil velocity at the peak.\nBy contrast, the computation of the linear-momentum\n\ufb02ux at higher PN orders is crucial for building more reli-\nable resummed expressions aimed at capturing the non-\nperturbative e\ufb00ects until merger [37, 39, 40, 41] and pre-\ndict the total recoil velocity.\nWe also provided expressions valid for generic orbits,\nand accurate at 2PN order, for the energy and angu-\nlar momentum carried by gravitational waves emitted\nfrom spinning binary black holes.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Abell 851 and the Role of Starbursts in Cluster Galaxy Evolution':\n\nIntroduction:\nThirty years of challenging observational work has con\ufb01rmed the existence of rapid recent\nevolution of the star formation rate of galaxies in rich clusters (Butcher & Oemler 1978, BO), and\nhas also provided support for BO\u2019s hypothesis that this evolution was caused by the transformation\nof spiral into S0 galaxies. However, despite this progress, no consensus has emerged concerning\nthe nature of the process or processes driving the evolution of the spiral galaxy population. BO\nhypothesized that spirials faded after ram pressure stripping by the intracluster medium removed\ntheir gas supply. However, Dressler & Gunn (1983) soon showed that many of the blue cluster\ngalaxies were undergoing starbursts, suggesting the working of processes more violent than the mere\nfading of star formation. Dressler & Gunn suggested that, rather than stripping the interstellar\nmedium from a galaxy, the cluster ram pressure induced a starburst which consumed the galaxy\u2019s\ngas. Since then, a number of other processes have been suggested, including starvation of a galaxy\u2019s\nstar formation by the removal of the outer gas halos that are posited to surround spirals and\nreplenish the disk gas by infall (Larson, Tinsley & Caldwell 1980), tidal shocks on a galaxy, either\ndue to the cluster core (e.g.\nByrd & Valtonen 1990, Henriksen & Byrd 1996), to unvirialized\nsubclusters (Gnedin 2003), or to other galaxies (Richstone & Malmuth 1983, Icke 1985, Moore\net al. (1996), and galaxy-galaxy mergers (Dressler et al. 1999, D99, van Dokkum et al. 1999, Struck\n2006).\nThese processes may be categorized in several ways, including method of gas removal, star\nformation history, and dependance on environment. In stripping and starvation, gas content and\nstar formation rate go hand-in-hand; as gas is swept from a galaxy or the external supply is shut\no\ufb00, there is a monotonic decrease in star formation rate. On the other hand, mergers, ram pressure\ninduced star formation, and tidal encounters (including harassment, the cumulative e\ufb00ect of many\nweak encounters [Moore et al. 1996]) work at least in part by a temporary increase in star formation\nrate, i.e. by a starburst which can consume much or most of the gas. The processes also di\ufb00er\nin their dependance on environment. All rely on interactions of a galaxy with its surroundings,\nbut harassment, ram pressure induced star formation and stripping work only in the hot, dense\nenvironment of a rich cluster core, while mergers are expected to be least e\ufb00ective in such a hot\nenvironment.\nOne might suppose that distinguishing between these very di\ufb00erent processes would be easy,\nbut this has not been so. A less-than-complete survey of 25 recent papers on the subject shows\nthat 8 papers support starvation as the explanation of cluster-driven evolution, 4 papers support\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nmergers, 3 support tidal encounters, 2 favor stripping, 2 favor ram pressure induced starbursts,\n1 supports harassment, 3 favor a combination of mergers plus stripping, 1 favors stripping plus\nstarvation and 1 favors stripping plus tidal encounters. Obviously, a consensus is not at hand.\nIn several previous papers (Poggianti et al. 1999, P99, Dressler et al. 2004, D04) we have pre-\nsented evidence supporting the importance of starbursts in cluster galaxy evolution. (De\ufb01nitions\nof \u201cstarbursts\u201d vary. We shall mean by this term a signi\ufb01cant temporary increase in the star for-\nmation rate of a galaxy above its long-term past average.) A companion paper to the present one\n(Dressler et al. 2009, hereafter D09) uses 24\u00b5m Spitzer observations of A851 to further elucidate the\nconnection between the optical spectral properties of cluster galaxies and the nature of the ongoing\nstarbursts. D09 show that galaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines and [O II] emission, which\nP99 and D04 have previously identi\ufb01ed as starbursts, are indeed young starbursts buried under ap-\npreciable dust extinction, while galaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines but no [O II] emission,\nwhich P99 and D04 identify as post-starburst galaxies, divide into two very di\ufb00erent classes. The\nmajority are true post-starbursts, but a signi\ufb01cant minority are declining starbursts in which op-\ntical emission from the remaining OB stars is completely hidden beneath dust. Together, these\npapers demonstrate that starbursts are a widespread phenomenon in galaxies at earlier epochs,\nboth within and outside of clusters. They also show that the post-starburst history of many cluster\ngalaxies is very di\ufb00erent than that of \ufb01eld galaxies: most \ufb01eld galaxies apparently resume normal\nstar formation after a burst but many cluster galaxies do not. These facts suggest that a combina-\ntion of starbursts plus an additional, cluster-speci\ufb01c process form at least one of the mechanisms\nresponsible for the evolution of the star formation in cluster galaxies. If correct, more information\non the environmental dependance of the phenomenon would clearly be useful for pinpointing the\ncluster-speci\ufb01c post-starburst process, as well as for elucidating the cause of the starbursts.\nIn this paper we present new HST imaging and ground-based spectroscopy of the cluster Abell\n851, at a redshift z = 0.41. A851 is not a \u201ctypical\u201d cluster; it is richer, has more substructure, and\nhas a larger population of starbursting and disturbed galaxies than the average z = 0.4 cluster.\nHowever, there is every reason to think that the processes occurring at the time of observation in\nA851 typify those occurring\u2014 at a somewhat lower rate\u2014 in all clusters at that epoch. It therefore\nrepresents a particularly useful laboratory for studying the evolution of cluster galaxies.\nThe data presented here cover a much wider area than have most previous observations of\nintermediate redshift clusters, allowing us to probe further out into the cluster, beyond the cluster\ncore and into the region where one might expect newly infalling galaxies and groups to predominate.\nThus they provide signi\ufb01cant new information on the environmental dependance of the evolutionary\nprocesses, and the larger data set and the addition of Spitzer IR photometry also allows us to\nstrengthen our previous conclusions about the origin and role of starbursts. We will demonstrate\nthat a majority of the galaxies in A851 with on-going or recent star formation have undergone\nsigni\ufb01cant starbursts, and that many are associated with unmistakable mergers. The most recent\nstarburst and merger events are concentrated in several kinematic and/or spatial subcomponents\nof the cluster, some of which we will suggest are currently infalling subclusters.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we describe the data used in this paper, and in \u00a73\nwe discuss the structure of the cluster derived from spatial and velocity distributions. In \u00a74 we\nrevisit the morphology/density relation for A851. In \u00a75 we discuss the analysis of the spectra of\nA851 members, correlate their properties with other galaxy and cluster parameters, and compare\nthem with those of \ufb01eld galaxies at the same epoch. In \u00a76 we examine the morphology and spatial\ndistribution of the starbursting population, and in \u00a77 try to deduce from these the origin of the\nstarbursts.\n\nConclusion:\nWe can summarize what we now know about A851 as follows:\n1. A851 is a complex system of merging subclusters, many with their own hot X-Ray gas content.\n2. Despite this, A851 shows a well-established morphology-density relation, with early type\ngalaxies concentrated in the densest lumps.\n3. In two infalling groups, an extremely high fraction of the starforming galaxies are undergoing\nstarbursts. The starburst rate in the main cluster is signi\ufb01cantly lower, except in the very\ncenter, but still much higher than in the \ufb01eld at the same epoch.\n4. The ratio of post-starburst objects to those currently undergoing starbursts is much higher\nin the main cluster than in either the infalling groups or the \ufb01eld.\n5. Most of the starbursts in the core of the main cluster are young, are buried behind very high\ndust extinction, and occur in galaxies which appear to be undergoing mergers . In contrast,\nthese characteristics apply to a minority of the group and \ufb01eld starbursts.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n6. There is a strong radial gradient in the age of the starbursts in the main cluster. The youngest\noccupy the very center, with older starbursts and post-starbursts occurring at progressively\ngreater cluster-centric distances.\nThese facts suggest that there are at least two causes of starbursts. In the cluster center, star-\nbursts are the result of galaxy-galaxy mergers, or more precisely major mergers in which the mass\nratio between the two galaxies is less than a few, since only such events produce the morphological\nsignatures seen in Fig.11. For reasons mentioned above, such major mergers are likely to be quite\ne\ufb00ective at removing a galaxy\u2019s gas, and therefore provide a simple explanation for the gas-free\npost-starburst objects found mostly in clusters. Furthermore, if Struck\u2019s (2005) arguments are to\nbe believed, the cores of rich clusters provide an unexpectedly hospitable environment for such\nmajor mergers. Such a core-centered process explains the radial gradient in the ages of starbursts\nseen in A851.\nThere are two worries about this otherwise satisfying picture. Firstly, it is commonly believed\nthat major mergers result in bulge-dominated galaxies, not disky objects like the post-starburst\nobjects seen in Fig. 11. Secondly, Stuck\u2019s mechanism, at least, requires that the bursting galaxies\nbe members of groups. Given the small number of objects involved at any one time, one would\nexpect them to be members of one or two groups. If the group(s) is infalling perpendicular to the\nline of sight one would expect a small velocity dispersion; if infalling along the line of sight one\nwould expect a small velocity dispersion and a large velocity o\ufb00set from the main cluster. Neither\nexpectation is met by the central starbursts, whose velocity distribution is very similar to that of\nthe entire cluster. These are serious problems. Nevertheless, the morphological evidence for major\nmergers is rather compelling, and the location of the bursts and the radial gradient in the ages of\nthe bursting and post-bursting galaxies strongly points to a process sited in the cluster core.\nThe other primary site of starbursts appears to be infalling groups. The starbursting group\nmembers, while often peculiar, show much less compelling evidence for major mergers than do the\ncore objects. Furthermore, group starbursts seems to produce gas-free post-starburst remnants\nmuch less frequently than do core starbursts.\nThe absence of ram-pressure stripping in these\nlow-density groups may be a partial explanation for this latter di\ufb00erence, but the available facts\nare consistent with a di\ufb00erent mechanism driving starbursts in this environment. Either minor\nmergers, with smaller mass ratios, tidal encounters, or the cluster tides proposed by Bekki may\nprovide a mechanism which is more consistent with the group starburst characteristics. Bekki\u2019s\nmechanism is particularly appealing because it can explain why the starburst rate in infalling groups\nis substantially higher than in the \ufb01eld- which is, after all, composed mostly of groups.\nA major question is the extent to which the processes observed in A851 are typical of other\nintermediate-redshift clusters of galaxies. It cannot be ignored that a substantial fraction of the 25\nrecent papers mentioned in \u00a71 \ufb01nd evidence for di\ufb00erent processes at work. For example, the very\nextensive studies of z \u223c0.4 clusters by Moran et al. (2005, 2007) provide compelling evidence for\na gradual fading of star formation in some cluster galaxies. A851 is, admittedly, a rather unusual\n\u2013 19 \u2013\ncluster, with more substructure and more disturbed galaxies than most. Nevertheless, astrophysical\nprocesses should be universal. It is reasonable to expect that what is observed occurring in the\ncore of A851, and in its infalling groups, has also occurred during some phases of the building\nof all rich clusters. Whether the average rate at which these processes occur in most clusters is\nsu\ufb03cient to entirely explain the transformation of spiral to S0 galaxies which characterizes the\nrecent evolution of cluster galaxies, or whether it is only one of a number of processes working in\nconcert is a question which only further observations of other clusters can answer.\nWe thank Ray Lucas at STScI for his enthusiastic help which enabled the e\ufb03cient gathering of\nthese HST observations.

New HST observations, Spitzer photometry and\nground-based spectroscopy cover most of a region of the cluster about 10 arcmin\nacross, corresponding to a clustercentric radial distance of about 1.6 Mpc.\nThis spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of a\nmorphology-density relation within this cluster, and to identify several large,\npresumably infalling, subsystems. We confirm our previous conclusion that a\nvery large fraction of the starforming galaxies in A851 have recently undergone\nstarbursts. We argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites:\ninfalling groups and the cluster center. At the cluster center it appears that\ninfalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whose\noptical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. The aftermath of\nthis process appears to be proto-S0 galaxies devoid of star formation. In\ncontrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starbursts\nin infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation of\nthe galaxy into an S0.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Synchronization mechanism of sharp edges in rings of Saturn':\n\nIntroduction:\nTogether with very small thickness, extreme sharp edges in\nrings of Saturn are one of the most outstanding features\nof planetary rings (see e.g. Fridman & Gorkavyi (1999);\nEsposito (2002, 2006); Borderis et al. (1982)). Indeed, for\nexample the outer B ring edge has a density drop by an or-\nder of magnitude on a distance re \u223c10m that is enormously\nsharp compared to the edge distance to Saturn (117580km),\nthe B ring width (25580km) and the width of Cassini divi-\nsion (4620km). This is especially surprising since the life\ntime of the rings is enormously large being of about 1012 or-\nbital periods (Fridman & Gorkavyi 1999) and the particles\ninside the B ring are quite dense (e.g. there are particles of\nsize 10m down to 1cm and smaller with a distance between\nthem of about a few meters and less) (Fridman & Gorkavyi\n1999; Esposito 2002, 2006; Spahn & Schmidt 2006). Due to\nthis about 10 \u2212100 collisions between particles per orbit\nshould wash out all sharp density contrasts in only a few\norbital periods.\nIn many cases, and perhaps always, these sharp edges\nare associated with the gravitational perturbation by a moon\ninside or outside the rings.

Like the Maxwell de-\nmon this synchronization makes the epicycle motion of par-\nticles to be synchronous that practically eliminates collisions\nbetween them. This gives a suppression of di\ufb00usion by or-\nders of magnitude and a formation of a di\ufb00usive shock wave\nslowly propagating inside the synchronization domain. The\nsize of this front or the edge of the ring is of the order of\na few epicycle radius being of about of a few tens of me-\nters. This is in agreement with the present observation data\nwhich give its size to be about 10 meters. The size of the\nsynchronization domain created by Mimas is of the order\nof 4000km (remarkably, the total number of synchronized\nparticles, which can be estimated as > 1012, is huge). The\nfront moves most slowly in the center of the synchronization\ndomain so that it is most probable to observe it at the exact\nresonance 2:1 between the edge frequency and the frequency\nof Mimas. The observations show that the actual position is\nclose to this value with a relative accuracy of 10\u22124 \u221210\u22125.\nSimilar synchronization e\ufb00ects should exist at other res-\nonances with other satellites. Our preliminary data give a\nsimilar picture for the outer A ring edge which is closely\nlocated to the 7:6 resonance with Janus (here the dimen-\nsionless kick strength is \u01eb \u22481.19 but the relative frequency\nsize of the synchronization window is approximately twice\nsmaller due to higher order of the resonance).\nThe synchronization mechanism proposed here can also\nbe responsible for existence of very narrow planetary rings.\nIndeed, if initially particles are distributed inside the reso-\nnance then those which are inside the synchronization win-\ndow will remain there practically forever since the collision\ninduced di\ufb00usion is switched o\ufb00, while those outside of the\nwindow will di\ufb00use away living a narrow ring of particles\ninside the synchronization window.\nThe SYNC model used in this paper is based on several\nsigni\ufb01cant simpli\ufb01cations of the real particle dynamics. The\nuse of the mesoscopic Kapral method for incorporating the\ncollisions appears to imply no additional physical mecha-\nnisms, but the basic physics of the collisions remains hidden\ninside the parameters of the Kapral method - the number\nof the cells and the frequency of the reshu\ufb04ing of velocities.\nTo make the calculations more realistic, one needs to incor-\nporate realistic collision models with reasonable mechanical\nproperties of the particles, to include a distribution of the\nsizes, etc. Such an extension goes far beyond the scope of\nour preliminary study. Thus we can hardly make direct pre-\ndictions, in particular, compare properties of A and B ring\nedges.\nMoreover, it appears that another simpli\ufb01cation of our\ncomputational model \u2013 the use of the Nos`e-Hoover thermo-\nstat \u2013 is less \u201crepairable\u201d and requires a further justi\ufb01cation.\nIndeed, if there is some average dissipation due to particle\ncollisions, this justi\ufb01es the use of the thermostat for model-\ning the saturation of the energy pumped to the system due\nto shear. On the other hand, in our setup in the synchro-\nnized state collisions are rare so at the \ufb01rst glance there is\nno mechanism for energy saturation. Here it is important\nto mention, that we restricted our analysis to an ensem-\nble of identical particles. For a particular situation in the\nouter B ring this means that we consider only large parti-\ncles that have low characteristic epicyclic velocities. If there\nis a whole range of particles of di\ufb00erent sizes, they are all\nsubject to resonant kicks by Mimas, but because their char-\nacteristic epicyclic velocities are di\ufb00erent, the e\ufb00ect of the\nkicks is also di\ufb00erent. If we assume rough equipartition of\nepicylic kinetic energies, then smaller particles have larger\nvelocities, therefore for them the e\ufb00ective forcing parameter\n\u01eb is smaller, and as a result they only weakly synchronize or\nnot synchronize (if they lie near the bottom of Fig. 2). Col-\nlisions with these randomly moving particles may provide\nan additional dissipation that justi\ufb01es the use of the Nos`e-\nHoover thermostat. Further investigations (which however\ngo far beyond the scope of this paper) of di\ufb00erent dissi-\nSynchronization mechanism of sharp edges in rings of Saturn\n7\npation e\ufb00ects in\ufb02uencing the energy balance are needed to\nclarify this issue.\nAnother simpli\ufb01cation made \u2013 a consideration of a rel-\natively small box of particles \u2013 is also crucial. Indeed, parts\nof the ring at di\ufb00erent angular coordinates are statistically\nequivalent, but the dynamical equivalence is broken by the\nin\ufb02uence of Mimas, as the latter kicks the particles at dif-\nferent phases. Thus the synchrony of the velocities may be\nonly local, i.e. the velocities of particles are synchronized\nwith the local phase of the Mimas, but this phase changes\ngradually along the ring angular coordinate. Because of the\ndi\ufb00erential rotation, the particles synchronized at di\ufb00erent\nphases will mix, but this e\ufb00ect is not taken into account in\nthe box model, it has to be addressed in future studies.\nIn this respect the important issue is that of how the\nsynchronization of particles\u2019 velocities could be tested ex-\nperimentally. Indeed, the theory above predicts a drastic\nnarrowing of the width of the velocities distribution, cf.\nFig. 1. However, because the velocities themselves are very\nsmall, there is no much hope to observe the distribution\nof them directly, e.g. by Doppler measurements or image\nanalysis. Thus one has to rely on implicit observations. For\nexample, one may expect that the adjustment of veloci-\nties in\ufb02uences other dynamical features recently observed in\nthe rings, like propeller structures (Sremcevic et al. (2007);\nSpahn & Schmidt (2006)). However, for such an implicit test\none has to \ufb01nd such structures quite near to the sharp edges\ndescribed above. Remarkably, near the outer edge of ring\nB a scrambled pattern is observed in recent Cassini images\n( see URL: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/\nindex.cfm?imageId=2984\n) that is probably due to a\ngravitational\nclumping\nof\nparticle\n(cf.\nsimulations\nby\nLewis & Stewart (2005) of a similar structure at the Encke\ngap). We can speculate that the synchronization of large\nparticles would generally enhance their ability to clump due\nto gravitational and adhesive forces, because their relative\ncollision velocities become rather small. On the other hand,\nif smaller, non-synchronized particles, leave the ring and en-\nter the gap, where large particles are missing, their di\ufb00usion\nwill be reduced as well, because the collisions between small\nparticles are rare. Observation of such a gradient in the size\ndistribution of particles near the edge may also be inter-\npreted as an implicit con\ufb01rmation of the suggested mecha-\nnism.\nWe note that in the literature several mechanisms for\nexplanation of sharp edges of rings have been discussed. One\nprocess to form and maintain a sharpness is a shear rever-\nsal induced by a strong gravitational perturbation near a\nresonance with a moon. In the unperturbed ring Keplerian\nshear leads to an outward viscous transport of angular mo-\nmentum. The distortions induced by a perturber may locally\nreverse the shear and, when integrating over the azimuth, to\na net angular momentum transport that is directed radially\ninward (Borderis et al. 1982, 1983, 1989; Mosqueira 1996).\nThis process can lead to an inward migration of material\nfrom the close vicinity of the resonance location with the\nmoon, and in this way clear a gap at this radial position in\nthe ring. Recently Lewis et al. reported on a \u201cnegative dif-\nfusion\u201d mechanism, where the particles migrate to areas of\nhigh density (Leezer & Lewis (2006)). In their calculations,\nhowever, only a single pass by the moon was simulated so\nno resonant e\ufb00ects, like those we focus on in this study, were\npossible. Probably, further observations, together with fur-\nther extensive numerical simulations, will allow one to test\nwhich mechanism is responsible for the sharp edges of the\nrings. It appears highly desirable to compare various setups\nin numerical simulations as well.\nFinally,\nwe\nnote\nthat,\nas\ndiscussed\nby\nChepelianskii et al.\n(2007),\nthe\nelimination\nof\ncolli-\nsional di\ufb00usion may appear also for charged particles in a\nmagnetic \ufb01eld like 2D electron gas (see Mani et al. (2002);\nZudov et al. (2003)) and electron and ion clouds in a Paul\ntrap (see, e.g., Mortenson et al. (2006)). Due to that it can\nbe rather interesting to try to make laboratory experiments\nwith traps (see e.g. Major et al. (2005)) which would allow\nto model rings of Saturn in laboratory experiments with\ncold ions.", "response": "We propose a new mechanism which explains the existence of enormously sharp\nedges in the rings of Saturn. This mechanism is based on the synchronization\nphenomenon due to which the epicycle rotational phases of particles in the\nring, under certain conditions, become synchronized with the phase of external\nsatellite, e.g. with the phase of Mimas in the case of the outer B ring edge.\nThis synchronization eliminates collisions between particles and suppress the\ndiffusion induced by collisions by orders of magnitude. The minimum of the\ndiffusion is reached at the center of the synchronization regime corresponding\nto the ratio 2:1 between the orbital frequency at the edge of B ring and the\norbital frequency of Mimas. The synchronization theory gives the sharpness of\nthe edge in few tens of meters that is in agreement with available\nobservations."}
{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'Disentangling age and metallicity in distant unresolved stellar systems':\n\nIntroduction:\nThe detailed study of the properties of distant stellar systems relies on the details\nto which the stellar population can be observed. The observation of single stars is,\nin principle, the way to extract the best information from a system. However, even\nwith modern telescopes, single stars can be observed only in nearby galaxies, and,\ntypically, at magnitudes signi\ufb01cantly brighter than the main sequence. Here, we discuss\na technique that has proved to be very powerful to disentangle the physical and chemical\nproperties of distant, unresolved stellar population, the Surface Brightness Fluctuations\n(SBF) method. Here, we summarize the main characteristics of the technique - for a\nmore detailed description of the SBF method see G. Raimondo, and J. P. Blakeslee\u2019s\ncontributes to this Volume.\nFirst introduced as a distance indicator for nearby elliptical galaxies [1], the SBF\nmethod has been applied to Galactic globular clusters at a few kpc, cluster ellipticals\nout to \u223c150 Mpc, and numerous lenticulars, spiral bulges, and dwarf spheroidals at\nintermediate distances [e.g. 2, 3, 4]. By de\ufb01nition the SBF signal corresponds to the\nratio of the 2nd to the 1st moment of the Luminosity Function (LF) of the stellar\npopulation. Therefore, the dominant contribution to SBF comes from bright stars which,\nacting as \u201clighthouses\u201d on a smooth background of faint stars, generate the great part of\nthe \ufb02uctuation signal. Further, the relative stellar luminosities depend on the observed\nbandpass, so the lighthouses at shorter wavelengths (hot stars) are different from those at\nlonger wavelength (cool stars), and the main contributors to the SBF change according\nto the \ufb01lter. This makes SBF magnitudes and colors potential candidate to trace the\nproperties of stellar population in unresolved systems.\nBased on such evidences we have carried out an extensive study of SBF, and correlated\nphotometric indicators, both on the theoretical and observational point of view. The main\nresults of these studies and future perspectives are brie\ufb02y outlined below.\n\nConclusion:", "response": "We present some results of an observational and theoretical study on\nunresolved stellar systems based on the Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF)\ntechnique.

{"prompt": "Summarize the Introduction and Conclusion of the following paper titled 'The Role of Massive Agb Stars in the Early Solar System Composition':\n\nIntroduction:\nThe formation of the solar system started with the collapse of a molecular cloud \nto produce a protostar surrounded by a disk of gas and dust (Cameron 1962; Elmegreen \n1985). The chemical composition of the solids initially present in this collapsing cloud \nlikely reflected the products of stellar evolution and outflow that occurred during \nGalactic history (Carlson and Lugmair, 2000). The isotopic composition, however, may \nbe strongly marked by the local environment where the solar system formed. In this \ncontext, the abundances of short-lived radionuclides (SLN, with half lives shorter than ~ \n2 Myr), inferred to have been present in the early solar system (ESS), are a stringent \nconstraint on the birth and early evolution of our solar system. This is because their \nrelatively short half lives do not allow the observed abundances to be explained by \ncontinuous Galactic uniform production (i.e., galactic chemical evolution processes), \nwhich, in turn, implies that some type of nucleosynthetic event must have occurred very \nclose in time and space to the forming Sun.  \n \nThe identification of SLN incorporated into chondritic components is a current \nhot topic in meteorite studies. Although they decayed a long time ago, their daughter \nproducts are found in meteorite components. The identification of these daughter \nisotopes allows us to obtain reasonable data on the abundances of SLN incorporated \ninto chondritic materials. For example, the abundance of 26Al and 60Fe in different \nmineral phases of meteoritic components provide clues on the contribution of these \nSLN to the primordial heating of planetesimals. Such contribution has shaped the \nfurther evolution of  planetesimals as we know from thermochronometry (see e.g. \nTrieloff et al., 2003). These studies demonstrate that the primordial heating was mainly \noriginated by the energy released by the decay of short-lived isotopes. In any case, \nadditional research is needed to provide clues on the initial abundances of these \nradioactive isotopes and also on the accretion time scales of the parent asteroids of \nprimitive meteorites. A quick accretion of these bodies will favor the role of short-lived \nisotopes in differentiation processes occurred in large asteroids.  \n \nIn Table 1 we provide a list of the SLN and other radioactive isotopes of interest \ndetected in the ESS. Most observed ratios are derived from the study of Calcium-\nAluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), which are generally considered to be the first objects \nthat formed in the solar system. According to the X-wind model proposed by Shu et al. \n(2001), CAIs were produced in the hottest regions of the protoplanetary disk (the \n\u201creconnection rings\u201d) by the continuous heating produced by periodic flare activity \nfrom the young Sun, and at the same time enriched in SLN via spallation reactions \ninduced by irradiation of solar energetic particles. Grossman (1972) had proposed much \nearlier that CAIs (and chondrules) formed by partial evaporation of material exhibiting \nCI chondrite (solar) composition with gas-melt exchange during flash heating events \nproduced in the nebula. A nebular shock front as modeled by Boss & Durisen (2005) \nwould heat CI-precursor materials to temperatures higher than 1,800 K during a few \nhours, explaining the observed CAI mineralogy. Alexander (2003), following the \nhypothesis of partial evaporation of CI dustballs, provided a uniform explanation of \nchondrule and CAI formation relatively far from the Sun (2-3 AU), in a less restrictive \nenvironment than the Shu et al. (2001) model. In this case, the dust precursor of CAIs \nwould be subjected to efficient mixing with interstellar material, particularly if the solar \nnebula formed in a dense stellar environment. Indeed, there is evidence that many low-\nmass stars form in large clusters (> 700 members) together with high-mass stars (Lada \nand Lada 2003). This argument was used later by Hester et al. (2004) to suggest that the \npresence of SLN (especially 60Fe with a half life of only 1.5 Myr) is direct evidence that \n \n3\nthe solar system formed in such an environment, where the ejecta from a core-collapse \nsupernova (SNII) quickly mixed with the material from which the meteorites formed. \nConnolly (2005) also proposed a similar argument, where he invoked mixing of early \nsolar-system material with SNII material.  \n \nThe first clue of the presence of 60Fe in the ESS was obtained from measured \nexcesses of 60Ni in CAIs, up to an extraordinarily high 60Fe/56Fe ratio of (1.6\u00b10.5)\u00d710-4 \n(Birck and Lugmair 1988). However, a more moderate initial ratio of 4\u00d710-6 was \ninferred from bulk samples (Birck and Lugmair 1988). More recent studies of troilite \n(FeS) grains contained in the Bishunpur and Krymka chondrites indicate a \n60Fe/56Fe=(1.08\u00b10.23)\u00d710-7 (Tachibana and Huss 2003). Evidence for the presence of \nthe radionuclide 26Al in CAIs, with an early solar system 26Al/27Al ratio of 5\u00d710-5 (the \n\u201ccanonical\u201d value; e.g., MacPherson et al. 1995) is provided by excesses of 26Mg that \nare correlated with 27Al. Among those CAIs containing detectable 26Mg excesses \nattributable to 26Al decay, most have a 26Al/27Al ratio of 3-6\u00d710-5. More recent results \n(e.g., Young et al. 2005) indicate that some samples display a \u201csupra-canonical\u201d value \nof 26Al/27Al\u223c6\u00d710-5. On the other hand, the vast majority of chondrules do not contain \nevidence for live 26Al during their formation. Hence, the amount of live 26Al apparently \ndecreased to a very low level during the formation of chondrules, suggesting that \nchondrules formed later than CAIs, even if some chondrules showing 26Mg excesses \n(26Al/27Al~8-9\u00d710-6) have been identified in three ordinary chondrites (Hutcheon and\n\nConclusion:", "response": "We demonstrate that a massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star is a good\ncandidate as the main source of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar\nsystem. Recent identification of massive (4-8 solar masses) AGB stars in the\nGalaxy, which are both lithium- and rubidium-rich, demonstrates that these\nstars experience proton captures at the base of the convective envelope (hot\nbottom burning), together with high-neutron density nucleosynthesis with 22Ne\nas a neutron source in the He shell and efficient dredge-up of the processed\nmaterial.
