    "summary": "AutoSteer is an automated and adaptive safety framework for MLLMs. It dynamically identifies safety-relevant layers and applies a lightweight safety prober and refusal mechanism at inference time. It proves especially effective in settings where traditional steering methods fall short. Inference-time safety defense is a promising approach to enhance MLLM safety without retraining.",
