    "title": "Reversal of the amplitude difference of kHz QPOs in six atoll sources",
    "summary": "AIMS: For six neutron-star atoll sources (4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53, 4U 0614+09,\n4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1735-44) we investigate the relationship between\nthe observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether\nthis displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the\nproposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude\nbetween the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.\nWe compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set\nII has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous\nsegments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we\nfind that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the\ntwo twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow\ninterval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources\nto explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.\nThere is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four\nsources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented\nclustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources\nstudied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the\nfrequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is\nroughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models,\nwith some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the\nexistence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at\nwhich the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a\nmore general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible\nexistence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.",

    "summary": "We investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physical\nparameters of high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), such as stellar mass,\nmean stellar population age, and star formation rate (SFR), obtained from\nbroad-band photometry. By combining LCDM hierarchical structure formation\ntheory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar population\nsynthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select LBGs\nat redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. The broad-band spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of these model LBGs are then analysed by fitting galaxy\ntemplate SEDs derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly\ndeclining SFRs. We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical\nparameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as\nderived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the\nsemi-analytic model. We find some trends in these distributions: first, when\nthe redshift is known, SED-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of\nLBGs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimate\nthe masses overall, but with substantial scatter. Second, there are large\nsystematic biases in the distributions of best-fit SFRs and mean ages, in the\nsense that single-component SED-fitting methods underestimate SFRs and\noverestimate ages. We attribute these trends to the different star formation\nhistories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxy\ntemplates used in SED-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from the\ncurrent generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. These\nbiases, which arise from the SED-fitting procedure, can significantly affect\ninferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.",
